These latter animals<a name="9425"></a>appear to have a natural capacity corresponding to each of the<a name="9426"></a>passions: to cunning or simplicity, courage or timidity, to good<a name="9427"></a>temper or to bad, and to other similar dispositions of mind.<a name="9428"></a><P class="indent">Some also are capable of giving or receiving instruction-of<a name="9429"></a>receiving it from one another or from man: those that have the faculty<a name="9430"></a>of hearing, for instance; and, not to limit the matter to audible<a name="9431"></a>sound, such as can differentiate the suggested meanings of word and<a name="9432"></a>gesture.<a name="9433"></a><P class="indent">In all genera in which the distinction of male and female is<a name="9434"></a>found, Nature makes a similar differentiation in the mental<a name="9435"></a>characteristics of the two sexes. This differentiation is the most<a name="9436"></a>obvious in the case of human kind and in that of the larger animals<a name="9437"></a>and the viviparous quadrupeds. In the case of these latter the<a name="9438"></a>female softer in character, is the sooner tamed, admits more readily<a name="9439"></a>of caressing, is more apt in the way of learning; as, for instance, in<a name="9440"></a>the Laconian breed of dogs the female is cleverer than the male. Of<a name="9441"></a>the Molossian breed of dogs, such as are employed in the chase are<a name="9442"></a>pretty much the same as those elsewhere; but sheep-dogs of this<a name="9443"></a>breed are superior to the others in size, and in the courage with<a name="9444"></a>which they face the attacks of wild animals.<a name="9445"></a><P class="indent">Dogs that are born of a mixed breed between these two kinds<a name="9446"></a>are remarkable for courage and endurance of hard labour.<a name="9447"></a><P class="indent">In all cases, excepting those of the bear and leopard, the<a name="9448"></a>female is less spirited than the male; in regard to the two<a name="9449"></a>exceptional cases, the superiority in courage rests with the female.<a name="9450"></a>With all other animals the female is softer in disposition than the<a name="9451"></a>male, is more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive, and more<a name="9452"></a>attentive to the nurture of the young: the male, on the other hand, is<a name="9453"></a>more spirited than the female, more savage, more simple and less<a name="9454"></a>cunning. The traces of these differentiated characteristics are more<a name="9455"></a>or less visible everywhere, but they are especially visible where<a name="9456"></a>character is the more developed, and most of all in man.<a name="9457"></a><P class="indent">The fact is, the nature of man is the most rounded off and<a name="9458"></a>complete, and consequently in man the qualities or capacities above<a name="9459"></a>referred to are found in their perfection. Hence woman is more<a name="9460"></a>compassionate than man, more easily moved to tears, at the same time<a name="9461"></a>is more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike.<a name="9462"></a>She is, furthermore, more prone to despondency and less hopeful than<a name="9463"></a>the man, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech,<a name="9464"></a>more deceptive, and of more retentive memory. She is also more<a name="9465"></a>wakeful, more shrinking, more difficult to rouse to action, and<a name="9466"></a>requires a smaller quantity of nutriment.<a name="9467"></a><P class="indent">As was previously stated, the male is more courageous than the<a name="9468"></a>female, and more sympathetic in the way of standing by to help. Even<a name="9469"></a>in the case of molluscs, when the cuttle-fish is struck with the<a name="9470"></a>trident the male stands by to help the female; but when the male is<a name="9471"></a>struck the female runs away.<a name="9472"></a><P class="indent">There is enmity between such animals as dwell in the same<a name="9473"></a>localities or subsist on the food. If the means of subsistence run<a name="9474"></a>short, creatures of like kind will fight together. Thus it is said<a name="9475"></a>that seals which inhabit one and the same district will fight, male<a name="9476"></a>with male, and female with female, until one combatant kills the<a name="9477"></a>other, or one is driven away by the other; and their young do even<a name="9478"></a>in like manner.<a name="9479"></a><P class="indent">All creatures are at enmity with the carnivores, and the<a name="9480"></a>carnivores with all the rest, for they all subsist on living<a name="9481"></a>creatures. Soothsayers take notice of cases where animals keep apart<a name="9482"></a>from one another, and cases where they congregate together; calling<a name="9483"></a>those that live at war with one another 'dissociates', and those<a name="9484"></a>that dwell in peace with one another 'associates'. One may go so far<a name="9485"></a>as to say that if there were no lack or stint of food, then those<a name="9486"></a>animals that are now afraid of man or are wild by nature would be tame<a name="9487"></a>and familiar with him, and in like manner with one another. This is<a name="9488"></a>shown by the way animals are treated in Egypt, for owing to the fact<a name="9489"></a>that food is constantly supplied to them the very fiercest creatures<a name="9490"></a>live peaceably together. The fact is they are tamed by kindness, and<a name="9491"></a>in some places crocodiles are tame to their priestly keeper from being<a name="9492"></a>fed by him. And elsewhere also the same phenomenon is to be observed.<a name="9493"></a><P class="indent">The eagle and the snake are enemies, for the eagle lives on<a name="9494"></a>snakes; so are the ichneumon and the venom-spider, for the ichneumon<a name="9495"></a>preys upon the latter. In the case of birds, there is mutual enmity<a name="9496"></a>between the poecilis, the crested lark, the woodpecker (?), and the<a name="9497"></a>chloreus, for they devour one another's eggs; so also between the crow<a name="9498"></a>and the owl; for, owing to the fact that the owl is dim-sighted by<a name="9499"></a>day, the crow at midday preys upon the owl's eggs, and the owl at<a name="9500"></a>night upon the crow's, each having the whip-hand of the other, turn<a name="9501"></a>and turn about, night and day.<a name="9502"></a><P class="indent">There is enmity also between the owl and the wren; for the<a name="9503"></a>latter also devours the owl's eggs. In the daytime all other little<a name="9504"></a>birds flutter round the owl-a practice which is popularly termed<a name="9505"></a>'admiring him'-buffet him, and pluck out his feathers; in<a name="9506"></a>consequence of this habit, bird-catchers use the owl as a decoy for<a name="9507"></a>catching little birds of all kinds.<a name="9508"></a><P class="indent">The so-called presbys or 'old man' is at war with the weasel and<a name="9509"></a>the crow, for they prey on her eggs and her brood; and so the<a name="9510"></a>turtle-dove with the pyrallis, for they live in the same districts and<a name="9511"></a>on the same food; and so with the green wood pecker and the libyus;<a name="9512"></a>and so with kite and the raven, for, owing to his having the advantage<a name="9513"></a>from stronger talons and more rapid flight the former can steal<a name="9514"></a>whatever the latter is holding, so that it is food also that makes<a name="9515"></a>enemies of these. In like manner there is war between birds that get<a name="9516"></a>their living from the sea, as between the brenthus, the gull, and<a name="9517"></a>the harpe; and so between the buzzard on one side and the toad and<a name="9518"></a>snake on the other, for the buzzard preys upon the eggs of the two<a name="9519"></a>others; and so between the turtle-dove and the chloreus; the<a name="9520"></a>chloreus kills the dove, and the crow kills the so-called<a name="9521"></a>drummer-bird.<a name="9522"></a><P class="indent">The aegolius, and birds of prey in general, prey upon the<a name="9523"></a>calaris, and consequently there is war between it and them; and so<a name="9524"></a>is there war between the gecko-lizard and the spider, for the former<a name="9525"></a>preys upon the latter; and so between the woodpecker and the heron,<a name="9526"></a>for the former preys upon the eggs and brood of the latter. And so<a name="9527"></a>between the aegithus and the ass, owing to the fact that the ass, in<a name="9528"></a>passing a furze-bush, rubs its sore and itching parts against the<a name="9529"></a>prickles; by so doing, and all the more if it brays, it topples the<a name="9530"></a>eggs and the brood out of the nest, the young ones tumble out in<a name="9531"></a>fright, and the mother-bird, to avenge this wrong, flies at the<a name="9532"></a>beast and pecks at his sore places.<a name="9533"></a><P class="indent">The wolf is at war with the ass, the bull, and the fox, for as<a name="9534"></a>being a carnivore, he attacks these other animals; and so for the same<a name="9535"></a>reason with the fox and the circus, for the circus, being<a name="9536"></a>carnivorous and furnished with crooked talons, attacks and maims the<a name="9537"></a>animal. And so the raven is at war with the bull and the ass, for it<a name="9538"></a>flies at them, and strikes them, and pecks at their eyes; and so<a name="9539"></a>with the eagle and the heron, for the former, having crooked talons,<a name="9540"></a>attacks the latter, and the latter usually succumbs to the attack; and<a name="9541"></a>so the merlin with the vulture; and the crex with the eleus-owl, the<a name="9542"></a>blackbird, and the oriole (of this latter bird, by the way, the<a name="9543"></a>story goes that he was originally born out of a funeral pyre): the<a name="9544"></a>cause of warfare is that the crex injures both them and their young.<a name="9545"></a>The nuthatch and the wren are at war with the eagle; the nuthatch<a name="9546"></a>breaks the eagle's eggs, so the eagle is at war with it on special<a name="9547"></a>grounds, though, as a bird of prey, it carries on a general war all<a name="9548"></a>round. The horse and the anthus are enemies, and the horse will<a name="9549"></a>drive the bird out of the field where he is grazing: the bird feeds on<a name="9550"></a>grass, and sees too dimly to foresee an attack; it mimics the<a name="9551"></a>whinnying of the horse, flies at him, and tries to frighten him<a name="9552"></a>away; but the horse drives the bird away, and whenever he catches it<a name="9553"></a>he kills it: this bird lives beside rivers or on marsh ground; it<a name="9554"></a>has pretty plumage, and finds its without trouble. The ass is at<a name="9555"></a>enmity with the lizard, for the lizard sleeps in his manger, gets into<a name="9556"></a>his nostril, and prevents his eating.<a name="9557"></a><P class="indent">Of herons there are three kinds: the ash coloured, the white,<a name="9558"></a>and the starry heron (or bittern). Of these the first mentioned<a name="9559"></a>submits with reluctance to the duties of incubation, or to union of<a name="9560"></a>the sexes; in fact, it screams during the union, and it is said<a name="9561"></a>drips blood from its eyes; it lays its eggs also in an awkward manner,<a name="9562"></a>not unattended with pain. It is at war with certain creatures that<a name="9563"></a>do it injury: with the eagle for robbing it, with the fox for worrying<a name="9564"></a>it at night, and with the lark for stealing its eggs.<a name="9565"></a><P class="indent">The snake is at war with the weasel and the pig; with the weasel<a name="9566"></a>when they are both at home, for they live on the same food; with the<a name="9567"></a>pig for preying on her kind. The merlin is at war with the fox; it<a name="9568"></a>strikes and claws it, and, as it has crooked talons, it kills the<a name="9569"></a>animal's young. The raven and the fox are good friends, for the<a name="9570"></a>raven is at enmity with the merlin; and so when the merlin assails the<a name="9571"></a>fox the raven comes and helps the animal. The vulture and the merlin<a name="9572"></a>are mutual enemies, as being both furnished with crooked talons. The<a name="9573"></a>vulture fights with the eagle, and so, by the way, does does swan; and<a name="9574"></a>the swan is often victorious: moreover, of all birds swans are most<a name="9575"></a>prone to the killing of one another.<a name="9576"></a><P class="indent">In regard to wild creatures, some sets are at enmity with<a name="9577"></a>other sets at all times and under all circumstances; others, as in the<a name="9578"></a>case of man and man, at special times and under incidental<a name="9579"></a>circumstances. The ass and the acanthis are enemies; for the bird<a name="9580"></a>lives on thistles, and the ass browses on thistles when they are young<a name="9581"></a>and tender. The anthus, the acanthis, and the aegithus are at enmity<a name="9582"></a>with one another; it is said that the blood of the anthus will not<a name="9583"></a>intercommingle with the blood of the aegithus. The crow and the<a name="9584"></a>heron are friends, as also are the sedge-bird and lark, the laedus and<a name="9585"></a>the celeus or green woodpecker; the woodpecker lives on the banks of<a name="9586"></a>rivers and beside brakes, the laedus lives on rocks and bills, and<a name="9587"></a>is greatly attached to its nesting-place. The piphinx, the harpe,<a name="9588"></a>and the kite are friends; as are the fox and the snake, for both<a name="9589"></a>burrow underground; so also are the blackbird and the turtle-dove. The<a name="9590"></a>lion and the thos or civet are enemies, for both are carnivorous and<a name="9591"></a>live on the same food. Elephants fight fiercely with one another,<a name="9592"></a>and stab one another with their tusks; of two combatants the beaten<a name="9593"></a>one gets completely cowed, and dreads the sound of his conqueror's<a name="9594"></a>voice. These animals differ from one another an extraordinary extent<a name="9595"></a>in the way of courage. Indians employ these animals for war<a name="9596"></a>purposes, irrespective of sex; the females, however, are less in<a name="9597"></a>size and much inferior in point of spirit. An elephant by pushing with<a name="9598"></a>his big tusks can batter down a wall, and will butt with his<a name="9599"></a>forehead at a palm until he brings it down, when he stamps on it and<a name="9600"></a>lays it in orderly fashion on the ground. Men hunt the elephant in the<a name="9601"></a>following way: they mount tame elephants of approved spirit and<a name="9602"></a>proceed in quest of wild animals; when they come up with these they<a name="9603"></a>bid the tame brutes to beat the wild ones until they tire the latter<a name="9604"></a>completely. Hereupon the driver mounts a wild brute and guides him<a name="9605"></a>with the application of his metal prong; after this the creature<a name="9606"></a>soon becomes tame, and obeys guidance. Now when the driver is on their<a name="9607"></a>back they are all tractable, but after he has dismounted, some are<a name="9608"></a>tame and others vicious; in the case of these latter, they tie their<a name="9609"></a>front-legs with ropes to keep them quiet. The animal is hunted whether<a name="9610"></a>young or full grown.<a name="9611"></a><P class="indent">Thus we see that in the case of the creatures above mentioned<a name="9612"></a>their mutual friendship or the is due to the food they feed on and the<a name="9613"></a>life they lead.</P><a name="9614"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap2">2</a><a name="9615"></a><P class="indent">Of fishes, such as swim in shoals together are friendly to one<a name="9616"></a>another; such as do not so swim are enemies. Some fishes swarm<a name="9617"></a>during the spawning season; others after they have spawned. To state<a name="9618"></a>the matter comprehensively, we may say that the following are shoaling<a name="9619"></a>fish: the tunny, the maenis, the sea-gudgeon, the bogue, the<a name="9620"></a>horse-mackerel, the coracine, the synodon or dentex, the red mullet,<a name="9621"></a>the sphyraena, the anthias, the eleginus, the atherine, the<a name="9622"></a>sarginus, the gar-fish, (the squid,) the rainbow-wrasse, the<a name="9623"></a>pelamyd, the mackerel, the coly-mackerel. Of these some not only<a name="9624"></a>swim in shoals, but go in pairs inside the shoal; the rest without<a name="9625"></a>exception swim in pairs, and only swim in shoals at certain periods:<a name="9626"></a>that is, as has been said, when they are heavy with spawn or after<a name="9627"></a>they have spawned.<a name="9628"></a><P class="indent">The basse and the grey mullet are bitter enemies, but they swarm<a name="9629"></a>together at certain times; for at times not only do fishes of the same<a name="9630"></a>species swarm together, but also those whose feeding-grounds are<a name="9631"></a>identical or adjacent, if the food-supply be abundant. The grey mullet<a name="9632"></a>is often found alive with its tail lopped off, and the conger with all<a name="9633"></a>that part of its body removed that lies to the rear of the vent; in<a name="9634"></a>the case of the mullet the injury is wrought by the basse, in that<a name="9635"></a>of the conger-eel by the muraena.

The forward-pointing tips of the growing horns (that is<a name="9710"></a>to say the brow antlers), with which the animal meets attack, are<a name="9711"></a>technically termed its 'defenders'; with these the patriarchs are<a name="9712"></a>unprovided, and their antlers merely grow straight upwards. Stags shed<a name="9713"></a>their horns annually, in or about the month of May; after shedding,<a name="9714"></a>they conceal themselves, it is said, during the daytime, and, to avoid<a name="9715"></a>the flies, hide in thick copses; during this time, until they have<a name="9716"></a>grown their horns, they feed at night-time. The horns at first grow in<a name="9717"></a>a kind of skin envelope, and get rough by degrees; when they reach<a name="9718"></a>their full size the animal basks in the sun, to mature and dry them.<a name="9719"></a>When they need no longer rub them against tree-trunks they quit<a name="9720"></a>their hiding places, from a sense of security based upon the<a name="9721"></a>possession of arms defensive and offensive. An Achaeine stag has<a name="9722"></a>been caught with a quantity of green ivy grown over its horns, it<a name="9723"></a>having grown apparently, as on fresh green wood, when the horns were<a name="9724"></a>young and tender. When a stag is stung by a venom-spider or similar<a name="9725"></a>insect, it gathers crabs and eats them; it is said to be a good<a name="9726"></a>thing for man to drink the juice, but the taste is disagreeable. The<a name="9727"></a>hinds after parturition at once swallow the afterbirth, and it is<a name="9728"></a>impossible to secure it, for the hind catches it before it falls to<a name="9729"></a>the ground: now this substance is supposed to have medicinal<a name="9730"></a>properties. When hunted the creatures are caught by singing or<a name="9731"></a>pipe-playing on the part of the hunters; they are so pleased with<a name="9732"></a>the music that they lie down on the grass. If there be two hunters,<a name="9733"></a>one before their eyes sings or plays the pipe, the other keeps out<a name="9734"></a>of sight and shoots, at a signal given by the confederate.

In the same way as men<a name="9803"></a>do, the bird mixes mud and chaff together; if it runs short of mud, it<a name="9804"></a>souses its body in water and rolls about in the dry dust with wet<a name="9805"></a>feathers; furthermore, just as man does, it makes a bed of straw,<a name="9806"></a>putting hard material below for a foundation, and adapting all to suit<a name="9807"></a>its own size.

In pairing the same male and the same female keep<a name="9815"></a>together; and the union is only broken by the death of one of the<a name="9816"></a>two parties. At the time of parturition in the female the<a name="9817"></a>sympathetic attentions of the male are extraordinary; if the female is<a name="9818"></a>afraid on account of the impending parturition to enter the nest,<a name="9819"></a>the male will beat her and force her to come in. When the young are<a name="9820"></a>born, he will take and masticate pieces of suitable food, will open<a name="9821"></a>the beaks of the fledglings, and inject these pieces, thus preparing<a name="9822"></a>them betimes to take food. (When the male bird is about to expel the<a name="9823"></a>the young ones from the nest he cohabits with them all.) As a<a name="9824"></a>general rule these birds show this conjugal fidelity, but occasionally<a name="9825"></a>a female will cohabit with other than her mate. These birds are<a name="9826"></a>combative, and quarrel with one another, and enter each other's nests,<a name="9827"></a>though this occurs but seldom; at a distance from their nests this<a name="9828"></a>quarrelsomeness is less marked, but in the close neighbourhood of<a name="9829"></a>their nests they will fight desperately. A peculiarity common to the<a name="9830"></a>tame pigeon, the ring-dove and the turtle-dove is that they do not<a name="9831"></a>lean the head back when they are in the act of drinking, but only when<a name="9832"></a>they have fully quenched their thirst. The turtle-dove and the<a name="9833"></a>ring-dove both have but one mate, and let no other come nigh; both<a name="9834"></a>sexes co-operate in the process of incubation. It is difficult to<a name="9835"></a>distinguish between the sexes except by an examination of their<a name="9836"></a>interiors. Ring-doves are long-lived; cases have been known where such<a name="9837"></a>birds were twenty-five years old, thirty years old, and in some<a name="9838"></a>cases forty. As they grow old their claws increase in size, and<a name="9839"></a>pigeon-fanciers cut the claws; as far as one can see, the birds suffer<a name="9840"></a>no other perceptible disfigurement by their increase in age.<a name="9841"></a>Turtle-doves and pigeons that are blinded by fanciers for use as<a name="9842"></a>decoys, live for eight years. Partridges live for about fifteen years.<a name="9843"></a>Ring-doves and turtle-doves always build their nests in the same place<a name="9844"></a>year after year. The male, as a general rule, is more long-lived<a name="9845"></a>than the female; but in the case of pigeons some assert that the<a name="9846"></a>male dies before the female, taking their inference from the<a name="9847"></a>statements of persons who keep decoy-birds in captivity.

After scraping a hole on a<a name="9861"></a>level piece of ground-and it is only in such a place that they lay<a name="9862"></a>their eggs-they cover it over with thorns and sticks for security<a name="9863"></a>against hawks and eagles, and there lay their eggs and hatch them;<a name="9864"></a>after the hatching is over, they at once lead the young out from the<a name="9865"></a>nest, as they are not able to fly afield for food for them. Quails and<a name="9866"></a>partridges, like barn-door hens, when they go to rest, gather their<a name="9867"></a>brood under their wings. Not to be discovered, as might be the case if<a name="9868"></a>they stayed long in one spot, they do not hatch the eggs where they<a name="9869"></a>laid them. When a man comes by chance upon a young brood, and tries to<a name="9870"></a>catch them, the hen-bird rolls in front of the hunter, pretending to<a name="9871"></a>be lame: the man every moment thinks he is on the point of catching<a name="9872"></a>her, and so she draws him on and on, until every one of her brood<a name="9873"></a>has had time to escape; hereupon she returns to the nest and calls the<a name="9874"></a>young back. The partridge lays not less than ten eggs, and often<a name="9875"></a>lays as many as sixteen. As has been observed, the bird has<a name="9876"></a>mischievous and deceitful habits. In the spring-time, a noisy<a name="9877"></a>scrimmage takes place, out of which the male-birds emerge each with<a name="9878"></a>a hen. Owing to the lecherous nature of the bird, and from a dislike<a name="9879"></a>to the hen sitting, the males, if they find any eggs, roll them over<a name="9880"></a>and over until they break them in pieces; to provide against this<a name="9881"></a>the female goes to a distance and lays the eggs, and often, under<a name="9882"></a>the stress of parturition, lays them in any chance spot that offers;<a name="9883"></a>if the male be near at hand, then to keep the eggs intact she refrains<a name="9884"></a>from visiting them. If she be seen by a man, then, just as with her<a name="9885"></a>fledged brood, she entices him off by showing herself close at his<a name="9886"></a>feet until she has drawn him to a distance. When the females have<a name="9887"></a>run away and taken to sitting, the males in a pack take to screaming<a name="9888"></a>and fighting; when thus engaged, they have the nickname of 'widowers'.<a name="9889"></a>The bird who is beaten follows his victor, and submits to be covered<a name="9890"></a>by him only; and the beaten bird is covered by a second one or by<a name="9891"></a>any other, only clandestinely without the victor's knowledge; this<a name="9892"></a>is so, not at all times, but at a particular season of the year, and<a name="9893"></a>with quails as well as with partridges. A similar proceeding takes<a name="9894"></a>place occasionally with barn-door cocks: for in temples, where cocks<a name="9895"></a>are set apart as dedicate without hens, they all as a matter of course<a name="9896"></a>tread any new-comer. Tame partridges tread wild birds, pecket their<a name="9897"></a>heads, and treat them with every possible outrage. The leader of the<a name="9898"></a>wild birds, with a counter-note of challenge, pushes forward to attack<a name="9899"></a>the decoy-bird, and after he has been netted, another advances with<a name="9900"></a>a similar note. This is what is done if the decoy be a male; but if it<a name="9901"></a>be a female that is the decoy and gives the note, and the leader of<a name="9902"></a>the wild birds give a counter one, the rest of the males set upon<a name="9903"></a>him and chase him away from the female for making advances to her<a name="9904"></a>instead of to them; in consequence of this the male often advances<a name="9905"></a>without uttering any cry, so that no other may hear him and come and<a name="9906"></a>give him battle; and experienced fowlers assert that sometimes the<a name="9907"></a>male bird, when he approaches the female, makes her keep silence, to<a name="9908"></a>avoid having to give battle to other males who might have heard him.<a name="9909"></a>The partridge has not only the note here referred to, but also a<a name="9910"></a>thin shrill cry and other notes. Oftentimes the hen-bird rises from<a name="9911"></a>off her brood when she sees the male showing attentions to the<a name="9912"></a>female decoy; she will give the counter note and remain still, so as<a name="9913"></a>to be trodden by him and divert him from the decoy. The quail and<a name="9914"></a>the partridge are so intent upon sexual union that they often come<a name="9915"></a>right in the way of the decoy-birds, and not seldom alight upon<a name="9916"></a>their heads.

There is<a name="10273"></a>another species called the 'true-bred'; people say that these are<a name="10274"></a>the only true-bred birds to be found, that all other birds-eagles,<a name="10275"></a>hawks, and the smallest birds-are all spoilt by the interbreeding of<a name="10276"></a>different species. The true-bred eagle is the largest of all eagles;<a name="10277"></a>it is larger than the phene; is half as large again as the ordinary<a name="10278"></a>eagle, and has yellow plumage; it is seldom seen, as is the case<a name="10279"></a>with the so-called cymindis. The time for an eagle to be on the wing<a name="10280"></a>in search of prey is from midday to evening; in the morning until<a name="10281"></a>the market-hour it remains on the nest. In old age the upper beak of<a name="10282"></a>the eagle grows gradually longer and more crooked, and the bird dies<a name="10283"></a>eventually of starvation; there is a folklore story that the eagle<a name="10284"></a>is thus punished because it once was a man and refused entertainment<a name="10285"></a>to a stranger. The eagle puts aside its superfluous food for its<a name="10286"></a>young; for owing to the difficulty in procuring food day by day, it at<a name="10287"></a>times may come back to the nest with nothing. If it catch a man<a name="10288"></a>prowling about in the neighbourhood of its nest, it will strike him<a name="10289"></a>with its wings and scratch him with its talons. The nest is built<a name="10290"></a>not on low ground but on an elevated spot, generally on an<a name="10291"></a>inaccessible ledge of a cliff; it does, however, build upon a tree.<a name="10292"></a>The young are fed until they can fly; hereupon the parent-birds topple<a name="10293"></a>them out of the nest, and chase them completely out of the locality.<a name="10294"></a>The fact is that a pair of eagles demands an extensive space for its<a name="10295"></a>maintenance, and consequently cannot allow other birds to quarter<a name="10296"></a>themselves in close neighbourhood. They do not hunt in the vicinity of<a name="10297"></a>their nest, but go to a great distance to find their prey. When the<a name="10298"></a>eagle has captured a beast, it puts it down without attempting to<a name="10299"></a>carry it off at once; if on trial it finds the burden too heavy, it<a name="10300"></a>will leave it. When it has spied a hare, it does not swoop on it at<a name="10301"></a>once, but lets it go on into the open ground; neither does it<a name="10302"></a>descend to the ground at one swoop, but goes gradually down from<a name="10303"></a>higher flights to lower and lower: these devices it adopts by way of<a name="10304"></a>security against the stratagem of the hunter. It alights on high<a name="10305"></a>places by reason of the difficulty it experiences in soaring up from<a name="10306"></a>the level ground; it flies high in the air to have the more<a name="10307"></a>extensive view; from its high flight it is said to be the only bird<a name="10308"></a>that resembles the gods. Birds of prey, as a rule, seldom alight<a name="10309"></a>upon rock, as the crookedness of their talons prevents a stable<a name="10310"></a>footing on hard stone. The eagle hunts hares, fawns, foxes, and in<a name="10311"></a>general all such animals as he can master with ease. It is a<a name="10312"></a>long-lived bird, and this fact might be inferred from the length of<a name="10313"></a>time during which the same nest is maintained in its place.</P><a name="10314"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap33">33</a><a name="10315"></a><P class="indent">In Scythia there is found a bird as large as the great bustard.<a name="10316"></a>The female lays two eggs, but does not hatch them, but hides them in<a name="10317"></a>the skin of a hare or fox and leaves them there, and, when it is not<a name="10318"></a>in quest of prey, it keeps a watch on them on a high tree; if any<a name="10319"></a>man tries to climb the tree, it fights and strikes him with its<a name="10320"></a>wing, just as eagles do.</P><a name="10321"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap34">34</a><a name="10322"></a><P class="indent">The owl and the night-raven and all the birds see poorly in the<a name="10323"></a>daytime seek their prey in the night, but not all the night through,<a name="10324"></a>but at evening and dawn.

The so-called phene, or lammergeier, is<a name="10326"></a>fond of its young, provides its food with ease, fetches food to its<a name="10327"></a>nest, and is of a kindly disposition. It rears its own young and those<a name="10328"></a>of the eagle as well; for when the eagle ejects its young from the<a name="10329"></a>nest, this bird catches them up as they fall and feeds them. For the<a name="10330"></a>eagle, by the way, ejects the young birds prematurely, before they are<a name="10331"></a>able to feed themselves, or to fly. It appears to do so from jealousy;<a name="10332"></a>for it is by nature jealous, and is so ravenous as to grab furiously<a name="10333"></a>at its food; and when it does grab at its food, it grabs it in large<a name="10334"></a>morsels. It is accordingly jealous of the young birds as they approach<a name="10335"></a>maturity, since they are getting good appetites, and so it scratches<a name="10336"></a>them with its talons. The young birds fight also with one another,<a name="10337"></a>to secure a morsel of food or a comfortable position, whereupon the<a name="10338"></a>mother-bird beats them and ejects them from the nest; the young ones<a name="10339"></a>scream at this treatment, and the phene hearing them catches them as<a name="10340"></a>they fall. The phene has a film over its eyes and sees badly, but<a name="10341"></a>the sea-eagle is very keen-sighted, and before its young are fledged<a name="10342"></a>tries to make them stare at the sun, and beats the one that refuses to<a name="10343"></a>do so, and twists him back in the sun's direction; and if one of<a name="10344"></a>them gets watery eyes in the process, it kills him, and rears the<a name="10345"></a>other.

When a sea-bird, emerging from the water, sees the sea-eagle, he<a name="10349"></a>in terror dives under, intending to rise again elsewhere; the eagle,<a name="10350"></a>however, owing to its keenness of vision, keeps flying after him until<a name="10351"></a>he either drowns the bird or catches him on the surface.

For the accounts commonly given of the so-called<a name="10394"></a>fishing-frog are quite true; as are also those given of the torpedo.<a name="10395"></a>The fishing-frog has a set of filaments that project in front of its<a name="10396"></a>eyes; they are long and thin like hairs, and are round at the tips;<a name="10397"></a>they lie on either side, and are used as baits. Accordingly, when<a name="10398"></a>the animal stirs up a place full of sand and mud and conceals itself<a name="10399"></a>therein, it raises the filaments, and, when the little fish strike<a name="10400"></a>against them, it draws them in underneath into its mouth. The<a name="10401"></a>torpedo narcotizes the creatures that it wants to catch,<a name="10402"></a>overpowering them by the power of shock that is resident in its<a name="10403"></a>body, and feeds upon them; it also hides in the sand and mud, and<a name="10404"></a>catches all the creatures that swim in its way and come under its<a name="10405"></a>narcotizing influence. This phenomenon has been actually observed in<a name="10406"></a>operation. The sting-ray also conceals itself, but not exactly in<a name="10407"></a>the same way. That the creatures get their living by this means is<a name="10408"></a>obvious from the fact that, whereas they are peculiarly inactive, they<a name="10409"></a>are often caught with mullets in their interior, the swiftest of<a name="10410"></a>fishes. Furthermore, the fishing-frog is unusually thin when he is<a name="10411"></a>caught after losing the tips of his filaments, and the torpedo is<a name="10412"></a>known to cause a numbness even in human beings.

These creatures never discharge the pigment in its<a name="10492"></a>entirety; and after a discharge the pigment accumulates again. The<a name="10493"></a>sepia, as has been said, often uses its colouring pigment for<a name="10494"></a>concealment; it shows itself in front of the pigment and then retreats<a name="10495"></a>back into it; it also hunts with its long tentacles not only little<a name="10496"></a>fishes, but oftentimes even mullets. The octopus is a stupid creature,<a name="10497"></a>for it will approach a man's hand if it be lowered in the water; but<a name="10498"></a>it is neat and thrifty in its habits: that is, it lays up stores in<a name="10499"></a>its nest, and, after eating up all that is eatable, it ejects the<a name="10500"></a>shells and sheaths of crabs and shell-fish, and the skeletons of<a name="10501"></a>little fishes. It seeks its prey by so changing its colour as to<a name="10502"></a>render it like the colour of the stones adjacent to it; it does so<a name="10503"></a>also when alarmed. By some the sepia is said to perform the same<a name="10504"></a>trick; that is, they say it can change its colour so as to make it<a name="10505"></a>resemble the colour of its habitat. The only fish that can do this<a name="10506"></a>is the angelfish, that is, it can change its colour like the<a name="10507"></a>octopus. The octopus as a rule does not live the year out. It has a<a name="10508"></a>natural tendency to run off into liquid; for, if beaten and<a name="10509"></a>squeezed, it keeps losing substance and at last disappears. The female<a name="10510"></a>after parturition is peculiarly subject to this colliquefaction; it<a name="10511"></a>becomes stupid; if tossed about by waves, it submits impassively; a<a name="10512"></a>man, if he dived, could catch it with the hand; it gets covered over<a name="10513"></a>with slime, and makes no effort to catch its wonted prey. The male<a name="10514"></a>becomes leathery and clammy. As a proof that they do not live into a<a name="10515"></a>second year there is the fact that, after the birth of the little<a name="10516"></a>octopuses in the late summer or beginning of autumn, it is seldom that<a name="10517"></a>a large-sized octopus is visible, whereas a little before this time of<a name="10518"></a>year the creature is at its largest. After the eggs are laid, they say<a name="10519"></a>that both the male and the female grow so old and feeble that they are<a name="10520"></a>preyed upon by little fish, and with ease dragged from their holes;<a name="10521"></a>and that this could not have been done previously; they say also<a name="10522"></a>that this is not the case with the small and young octopus, but that<a name="10523"></a>the young creature is much stronger than the grown-up one.

Of the venomous<a name="10560"></a>phalangia there are two; one that resembles the so-called wolf-spider,<a name="10561"></a>small, speckled, and tapering to a point; it moves with leaps, from<a name="10562"></a>which habit it is nicknamed 'the flea': the other kind is large, black<a name="10563"></a>in colour, with long front legs; it is heavy in its movements, walks<a name="10564"></a>slowly, is not very strong, and never leaps. (Of all the other species<a name="10565"></a>wherewith poison-vendors supply themselves, some give a weak bite, and<a name="10566"></a>others never bite at all. There is another kind, comprising the<a name="10567"></a>so-called wolf-spiders.) Of these spiders the small one weaves no web,<a name="10568"></a>and the large weaves a rude and poorly built one on the ground or on<a name="10569"></a>dry stone walls. It always builds its web over hollow places inside of<a name="10570"></a>which it keeps a watch on the end-threads, until some creature gets<a name="10571"></a>into the web and begins to struggle, when out the spider pounces.<a name="10572"></a>The speckled kind makes a little shabby web under trees.<a name="10573"></a><P class="indent">There is a third species of this animal, preeminently clever and<a name="10574"></a>artistic. It first weaves a thread stretching to all the exterior ends<a name="10575"></a>of the future web; then from the centre, which it hits upon with great<a name="10576"></a>accuracy, it stretches the warp; on the warp it puts what<a name="10577"></a>corresponds to the woof, and then weaves the whole together. It sleeps<a name="10578"></a>and stores its food away from the centre, but it is at the centre that<a name="10579"></a>it keeps watch for its prey. Then, when any creature touches the web<a name="10580"></a>and the centre is set in motion, it first ties and wraps the<a name="10581"></a>creature round with threads until it renders it helpless, then lifts<a name="10582"></a>it and carries it off, and, if it happens to be hungry, sucks out<a name="10583"></a>the life-juices--for that is the way it feeds; but, if it be not<a name="10584"></a>hungry, it first mends any damage done and then hastens again to its<a name="10585"></a>quest of prey. If something comes meanwhile into the net, the spider<a name="10586"></a>at first makes for the centre, and then goes back to its entangled<a name="10587"></a>prey as from a fixed starting point. If any one injures a portion of<a name="10588"></a>the web, it recommences weaving at sunrise or at sunset, because it is<a name="10589"></a>chiefly at these periods that creatures are caught in the web. It is<a name="10590"></a>the female that does the weaving and the hunting, but the male takes a<a name="10591"></a>share of the booty captured.<a name="10592"></a><P class="indent">Of the skilful spiders, weaving a substantial web, there are two<a name="10593"></a>kinds, the larger and the smaller. The one has long legs and keeps<a name="10594"></a>watch while swinging downwards from the web: from its large size it<a name="10595"></a>cannot easily conceal itself, and so it keeps underneath, so that<a name="10596"></a>its prey may not be frightened off, but may strike upon the web's<a name="10597"></a>upper surface; the less awkwardly formed one lies in wait on the<a name="10598"></a>top, using a little hole for a lurking-place. Spiders can spin webs<a name="10599"></a>from the time of their birth, not from their interior as a superfluity<a name="10600"></a>or excretion, as Democritus avers, but off their body as a kind of<a name="10601"></a>tree-bark, like the creatures that shoot out with their hair, as for<a name="10602"></a>instance the porcupine. The creature can attack animals larger than<a name="10603"></a>itself, and enwrap them with its threads: in other words, it will<a name="10604"></a>attack a small lizard, run round and draw threads about its mouth<a name="10605"></a>until it closes the mouth up; then it comes up and bites it.</P><a name="10606"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap40">40</a><a name="10607"></a><P class="indent">So much for the spider. Of insects, there is a genus that has no<a name="10608"></a>one name that comprehends all the species, though all the species<a name="10609"></a>are akin to one another in form; it consists of all the insects that<a name="10610"></a>construct a honeycomb: to wit, the bee, and all the insects that<a name="10611"></a>resemble it in form.<a name="10612"></a><P class="indent">There are nine varieties, of which six are gregarious-the bee, the<a name="10613"></a>king-bee, the drone bee, the annual wasp, and, furthermore, the<a name="10614"></a>anthrene (or hornet), and the tenthredo (or ground-wasp); three are<a name="10615"></a>solitary-the smaller siren, of a dun colour, the larger siren, black<a name="10616"></a>and speckled, and the third, the largest of all, that is called the<a name="10617"></a>humble-bee. Now ants never go a-hunting, but gather up what is ready<a name="10618"></a>to hand; the spider makes nothing, and lays up no store, but simply<a name="10619"></a>goes a-hunting for its food; while the bee--for we shall by and by<a name="10620"></a>treat of the nine varieties--does not go a-hunting, but constructs its<a name="10621"></a>food out of gathered material and stores it away, for honey is the<a name="10622"></a>bee's food. This fact is shown by the beekeepers' attempt to remove<a name="10623"></a>the combs; for the bees, when they are fumigated, and are suffering<a name="10624"></a>great distress from the process, then devour the honey most<a name="10625"></a>ravenously, whereas at other times they are never observed to be so<a name="10626"></a>greedy, but apparently are thrifty and disposed to lay by for their<a name="10627"></a>future sustenance. They have also another food which is called<a name="10628"></a>bee-bread; this is scarcer than honey and has a sweet figlike taste;<a name="10629"></a>this they carry as they do the wax on their legs.<a name="10630"></a><P class="indent">Very remarkable diversity is observed in their methods of<a name="10631"></a>working and their general habits. When the hive has been delivered<a name="10632"></a>to them clean and empty, they build their waxen cells, bringing in the<a name="10633"></a>juice of all kinds of flowers and the 'tears' or exuding sap of trees,<a name="10634"></a>such as willows and elms and such others as are particularly given<a name="10635"></a>to the exudation of gum. With this material they besmear the<a name="10636"></a>groundwork, to provide against attacks of other creatures; the<a name="10637"></a>bee-keepers call this stuff 'stop-wax'. They also with the same<a name="10638"></a>material narrow by side-building the entrances to the hive if they are<a name="10639"></a>too wide. They first build cells for themselves; then for the<a name="10640"></a>so-called kings and the drones; for themselves they are always<a name="10641"></a>building, for the kings only when the brood of young is numerous,<a name="10642"></a>and cells for the drones they build if a superabundance of honey<a name="10643"></a>should suggest their doing so. They build the royal cells next to<a name="10644"></a>their own, and they are of small bulk; the drones' cells they build<a name="10645"></a>near by, and these latter are less in bulk than the bee's cells.<a name="10646"></a><P class="indent">They begin building the combs downwards from the top of the<a name="10647"></a>hive, and go down and down building many combs connected together<a name="10648"></a>until they reach the bottom. The cells, both those for the honey and<a name="10649"></a>those also for the grubs, are double-doored; for two cells are<a name="10650"></a>ranged about a single base, one pointing one way and one the other,<a name="10651"></a>after the manner of a double (or hour-glass-shaped) goblet. The<a name="10652"></a>cells that lie at the commencement of the combs and are attached to<a name="10653"></a>the hives, to the extent of two or three concentric circular rows, are<a name="10654"></a>small and devoid of honey; the cells that are well filled with honey<a name="10655"></a>are most thoroughly luted with wax. At the entry to the hive the<a name="10656"></a>aperture of the doorway is smeared with mitys; this substance is a<a name="10657"></a>deep black, and is a sort of dross or residual by-product of wax; it<a name="10658"></a>has a pungent odour, and is a cure for bruises and suppurating<a name="10659"></a>sores. The greasy stuff that comes next is pitch-wax; it has a less<a name="10660"></a>pungent odour and is less medicinal than the mitys. Some say that<a name="10661"></a>the drones construct combs by themselves in the same hive and in the<a name="10662"></a>same comb that they share with the bees; but that they make no<a name="10663"></a>honey, but subsist, they and their grubs also, on the honey made by<a name="10664"></a>the bees. The drones, as a rule, keep inside the hive; when they go<a name="10665"></a>out of doors, they soar up in the air in a stream, whirling round<a name="10666"></a>and round in a kind of gymnastic exercise; when this is over, they<a name="10667"></a>come inside the hive and feed to repletion ravenously. The kings never<a name="10668"></a>quit the hive, except in conjunction with the entire swarm, either for<a name="10669"></a>food or for any other reason. They say that, if a young swarm go<a name="10670"></a>astray, it will turn back upon its route and by the aid of scent<a name="10671"></a>seek out its leader. It is said that if he is unable to fly he is<a name="10672"></a>carried by the swarm, and that if he dies the swarm perishes; and<a name="10673"></a>that, if this swarm outlives the king for a while and constructs<a name="10674"></a>combs, no honey is produced and the bees soon die out.<a name="10675"></a><P class="indent">Bees scramble up the stalks of flowers and rapidly gather the<a name="10676"></a>bees-wax with their front legs; the front legs wipe it off on to the<a name="10677"></a>middle legs, and these pass it on to the hollow curves of the<a name="10678"></a>hind-legs; when thus laden, they fly away home, and one may see<a name="10679"></a>plainly that their load is a heavy one. On each expedition the bee<a name="10680"></a>does not fly from a flower of one kind to a flower of another, but<a name="10681"></a>flies from one violet, say, to another violet, and never meddles<a name="10682"></a>with another flower until it has got back to the hive; on reaching the<a name="10683"></a>hive they throw off their load, and each bee on his return is<a name="10684"></a>accompanied by three or four companions. One cannot well tell what<a name="10685"></a>is the substance they gather, nor the exact process of their work.<a name="10686"></a>Their mode of gathering wax has been observed on olive-trees, as owing<a name="10687"></a>to the thickness of the leaves the bees remain stationary for a<a name="10688"></a>considerable while. After this work is over, they attend to the grubs.<a name="10689"></a>There is nothing to prevent grubs, honey, and drones being all found<a name="10690"></a>in one and the same comb. As long as the leader is alive, the drones<a name="10691"></a>are said to be produced apart by themselves; if he be no longer<a name="10692"></a>living, they are said to be reared by the bees in their own cells, and<a name="10693"></a>under these circumstances to become more spirited: for this reason<a name="10694"></a>they are called 'sting-drones', not that they really have stings,<a name="10695"></a>but that they have the wish without the power, to use such weapons.<a name="10696"></a>The cells for the drones are larger than the others; sometimes the<a name="10697"></a>bees construct cells for the drones apart, but usually they put them<a name="10698"></a>in amongst their own; and when this is the case the bee-keepers cut<a name="10699"></a>the drone-cells out of the combs.<a name="10700"></a><P class="indent">There are several species of bees, as has been said; two of<a name="10701"></a>'kings', the better kind red, the other black and variegated, and<a name="10702"></a>twice as big as the working-bee. The best workingbee is small,<a name="10703"></a>round, and speckled: another kind is long and like an anthrene wasp;<a name="10704"></a>another kind is what is called the robber-bee, black and flat-bellied;<a name="10705"></a>then there is the drone, the largest of all, but devoid of sting,<a name="10706"></a>and lazy. There is a difference between the progeny of bees that<a name="10707"></a>inhabit cultivated land and of those from the mountains: the<a name="10708"></a>forest-bees are more shaggy, smaller, more industrious and more<a name="10709"></a>fierce. Working-bees make their combs all even, with the superficial<a name="10710"></a>covering quite smooth. Each comb is of one kind only: that is, it<a name="10711"></a>contains either bees only, or grubs only, or drones only; if it<a name="10712"></a>happen, however, that they make in one and the same comb all these<a name="10713"></a>kinds of cells, each separate kind will be built in a continuous row<a name="10714"></a>right through. The long bees build uneven combs, with the lids of<a name="10715"></a>the cells protuberant, like those of the anthrene; grubs and<a name="10716"></a>everything else have no fixed places, but are put anywhere; from these<a name="10717"></a>bees come inferior kings, a large quantity of drones, and the<a name="10718"></a>so-called robber-bee; they produce either no honey at all, or honey in<a name="10719"></a>very small quantities. Bees brood over the combs and so mature them;<a name="10720"></a>if they fail to do so, the combs are said to go bad and to get covered<a name="10721"></a>with a sort of spider's web. If they can keep brooding over the part<a name="10722"></a>undamaged, the damaged part simply eats itself away; if they cannot so<a name="10723"></a>brood, the entire comb perishes; in the damaged combs small worms<a name="10724"></a>are engendered, which take on wings and fly away. When the combs<a name="10725"></a>keep settling down, the bees restore the level surface, and put<a name="10726"></a>props underneath the combs to give themselves free passage-room; for<a name="10727"></a>if such free passage be lacking they cannot brood, and the cobwebs<a name="10728"></a>come on. When the robber-bee and the drone appear, not only do they do<a name="10729"></a>no work themselves, but they actually damage the work of the other<a name="10730"></a>bees; if they are caught in the act, they are killed by the<a name="10731"></a>working-bees. These bees also kill without mercy most of their<a name="10732"></a>kings, and especially kings of the inferior sort; and this they do for<a name="10733"></a>fear a multiplicity of kings should lead to a dismemberment of the<a name="10734"></a>hive. They kill them especially when the hive is deficient in grubs,<a name="10735"></a>and a swarm is not intended to take place; under these circumstances<a name="10736"></a>they destroy the cells of the kings if they have been prepared, on the<a name="10737"></a>ground that these kings are always ready to lead out swarms. They<a name="10738"></a>destroy also the combs of the drones if a failure in the supply be<a name="10739"></a>threatening and the hive runs short of provisions; under such<a name="10740"></a>circumstances they fight desperately with all who try to take their<a name="10741"></a>honey, and eject from the hive all the resident drones; and oftentimes<a name="10742"></a>the drones are to be seen sitting apart in the hive. The little bees<a name="10743"></a>fight vigorously with the long kind, and try to banish them from the<a name="10744"></a>hives; if they succeed, the hive will be unusually productive, but<a name="10745"></a>if the bigger bees get left mistresses of the field they pass the time<a name="10746"></a>in idleness, and no good at all but die out before the autumn.<a name="10747"></a>Whenever the working-bees kill an enemy they try to do so out of<a name="10748"></a>doors; and whenever one of their own body dies, they carry the dead<a name="10749"></a>bee out of doors also. The so-called robber-bees spoil their own<a name="10750"></a>combs, and, if they can do so unnoticed, enter and spoil the combs<a name="10751"></a>of other bees; if they are caught in the act they are put to death. It<a name="10752"></a>is no easy task for them to escape detection, for there are<a name="10753"></a>sentinels on guard at every entry; and, even if they do escape<a name="10754"></a>detection on entering, afterwards from a surfeit of food they cannot<a name="10755"></a>fly, but go rolling about in front of the hive, so that their<a name="10756"></a>chances of escape are small indeed. The kings are never themselves<a name="10757"></a>seen outside the hive except with a swarm in flight: during which time<a name="10758"></a>all the other bees cluster around them. When the flight of a swarm<a name="10759"></a>is imminent, a monotonous and quite peculiar sound made by all the<a name="10760"></a>bees is heard for several days, and for two or three days in advance a<a name="10761"></a>few bees are seen flying round the hive; it has never as yet been<a name="10762"></a>ascertained, owing to the difficulty of the observation, whether or no<a name="10763"></a>the king is among these. When they have swarmed, they fly away and<a name="10764"></a>separate off to each of the kings; if a small swarm happens to<a name="10765"></a>settle near to a large one, it will shift to join this large one,<a name="10766"></a>and if the king whom they have abandoned follows them, they put him to<a name="10767"></a>death. So much for the quitting of the hive and the swarmflight.<a name="10768"></a>Separate detachments of bees are told off for diverse operations; that<a name="10769"></a>is, some carry flower-produce, others carry water, others smooth and<a name="10770"></a>arrange the combs. A bee carries water when it is rearing grubs. No<a name="10771"></a>bee ever settles on the flesh of any creature, or ever eats animal<a name="10772"></a>food. They have no fixed date for commencing work; but when their<a name="10773"></a>provender is forthcoming and they are in comfortable trim, and by<a name="10774"></a>preference in summer, they set to work, and when the weather is fine<a name="10775"></a>they work incessantly.<a name="10776"></a><P class="indent">The bee, when quite young and in fact only three days old, after<a name="10777"></a>shedding its chrysalis-case, begins to work if it be well fed. When<a name="10778"></a>a swarm is settling, some bees detach themselves in search of food and<a name="10779"></a>return back to the swarm. In hives that are in good condition the<a name="10780"></a>production of young bees is discontinued only for the forty days<a name="10781"></a>that follow the winter solstice. When the grubs are grown, the bees<a name="10782"></a>put food beside them and cover them with a coating of wax; and, as<a name="10783"></a>soon as the grub is strong enough, he of his own accord breaks the lid<a name="10784"></a>and comes out. Creatures that make their appearance in hives and spoil<a name="10785"></a>the combs the working-bees clear out, but the other bees from sheer<a name="10786"></a>laziness look with indifference on damage done to their produce.<a name="10787"></a>When the bee-masters take out the combs, they leave enough food behind<a name="10788"></a>for winter use; if it be sufficient in quantity, the occupants of<a name="10789"></a>the hive will survive; if it be insufficient, then, if the weather<a name="10790"></a>be rough, they die on the spot, but if it be fair, they fly away and<a name="10791"></a>desert the hive. They feed on honey summer and winter; but they<a name="10792"></a>store up another article of food resembling wax in hardness, which<a name="10793"></a>by some is called sandarace, or bee-bread. Their worst enemies are<a name="10794"></a>wasps and the birds named titmice, and furthermore the swallow and the<a name="10795"></a>bee-eater. The frogs in the marsh also catch them if they come in<a name="10796"></a>their way by the water-side, and for this reason bee-keepers chase the<a name="10797"></a>frogs from the ponds from which the bees take water; they destroy also<a name="10798"></a>wasps' nests, and the nests of swallows, in the neighbourhood of the<a name="10799"></a>hives, and also the nests of bee-eaters. Bees have fear only of one<a name="10800"></a>another. They fight with one another and with wasps. Away from the<a name="10801"></a>hive they attack neither their own species nor any other creature, but<a name="10802"></a>in the close proximity of the hive they kill whatever they get hold<a name="10803"></a>of. Bees that sting die from their inability to extract the sting<a name="10804"></a>without at the same time extracting their intestines. True, they often<a name="10805"></a>recover, if the person stung takes the trouble to press the sting out;<a name="10806"></a>but once it loses its sting the bee must die. They can kill with their<a name="10807"></a>stings even large animals; in fact, a horse has been known to have<a name="10808"></a>been stung to death by them. The kings are the least disposed to<a name="10809"></a>show anger or to inflict a sting. Bees that die are removed from the<a name="10810"></a>hive, and in every way the creature is remarkable for its cleanly<a name="10811"></a>habits; in point of fact, they often fly away to a distance to void<a name="10812"></a>their excrement because it is malodorous; and, as has been said,<a name="10813"></a>they are annoyed by all bad smells and by the scent of perfumes, so<a name="10814"></a>much so that they sting people that use perfumes.<a name="10815"></a><P class="indent">They perish from a number of accidental causes, and when their<a name="10816"></a>kings become too numerous and try each to carry away a portion of<a name="10817"></a>the swarm.<a name="10818"></a><P class="indent">The toad also feeds on bees; he comes to the doorway of the<a name="10819"></a>hive, puffs himself out as he sits on the watch, and devours the<a name="10820"></a>creatures as they come flying out; the bees can in no way retaliate,<a name="10821"></a>but the bee-keeper makes a point of killing him.<a name="10822"></a><P class="indent">As for the class of bee that has been spoken of as inferior or<a name="10823"></a>good-for-nothing, and as constructing its combs so roughly, some<a name="10824"></a>bee-keepers say that it is the young bees that act so from<a name="10825"></a>inexperience; and the bees of the current year are termed young. The<a name="10826"></a>young bees do not sting as the others do; and it is for this reason<a name="10827"></a>that swarms may be safely carried, as it is of young bees that they<a name="10828"></a>are composed. When honey runs short they expel the drones, and the<a name="10829"></a>bee-keepers supply the bees with figs and sweet-tasting articles of<a name="10830"></a>food. The elder bees do the indoor work, and are rough and hairy<a name="10831"></a>from staying indoors; the young bees do the outer carrying, and are<a name="10832"></a>comparatively smooth. They kill the drones also when in their work<a name="10833"></a>they are confined for room; the drones, by the way, live in the<a name="10834"></a>innermost recess of the hive. On one occasion, when a hive was in a<a name="10835"></a>poor condition, some of the occupants assailed a foreign hive; proving<a name="10836"></a>victorious in a combat they took to carrying off the honey; when the<a name="10837"></a>bee-keeper tried to kill them, the other bees came out and tried to<a name="10838"></a>beat off the enemy but made no attempt to sting the man.<a name="10839"></a><P class="indent">The diseases that chiefly attack prosperous hives are first of all<a name="10840"></a>the clerus-this consists in a growth of little worms on the floor,<a name="10841"></a>from which, as they develop, a kind of cobweb grows over the entire<a name="10842"></a>hive, and the combs decay; another diseased condition is indicated<a name="10843"></a>in a lassitude on the part of the bees and in malodorousness of the<a name="10844"></a>hive. Bees feed on thyme; and the white thyme is better than the<a name="10845"></a>red. In summer the place for the hive should be cool, and in winter<a name="10846"></a>warm. They are very apt to fall sick if the plant they are at work<a name="10847"></a>on be mildewed. In a high wind they carry a stone by way of ballast to<a name="10848"></a>steady them. If a stream be near at hand, they drink from it and<a name="10849"></a>from it only, but before they drink they first deposit their load;<a name="10850"></a>if there be no water near at hand, they disgorge their honey as they<a name="10851"></a>drink elsewhere, and at once make off to work. There are two seasons<a name="10852"></a>for making honey, spring and autumn; the spring honey is sweeter,<a name="10853"></a>whiter, and in every way better than the autumn honey. Superior<a name="10854"></a>honey comes from fresh comb, and from young shoots; the red honey is<a name="10855"></a>inferior, and owes its inferiority to the comb in which it is<a name="10856"></a>deposited, just as wine is apt to be spoiled by its cask;<a name="10857"></a>consequently, one should have it looked to and dried. When the thyme<a name="10858"></a>is in flower and the comb is full, the honey does not harden. The<a name="10859"></a>honey that is golden in hue is excellent. White honey does not come<a name="10860"></a>from thyme pure and simple; it is good as a salve for sore eyes and<a name="10861"></a>wounds. Poor honey always floats on the surface and should be<a name="10862"></a>skimmed off; the fine clear honey rests below. When the floral world<a name="10863"></a>is in full bloom, then they make wax; consequently you must then<a name="10864"></a>take the wax out of the hive, for they go to work on new wax at<a name="10865"></a>once. The flowers from which they gather honey are as follows: the<a name="10866"></a>spindle-tree, the melilot-clover, king's-spear, myrtle,<a name="10867"></a>flowering-reed, withy, and broom. When they work at thyme, they mix in<a name="10868"></a>water before sealing up the comb. As has been already stated, they all<a name="10869"></a>either fly to a distance to discharge their excrement or make the<a name="10870"></a>discharge into one single comb. The little bees, as has been said, are<a name="10871"></a>more industrious than the big ones; their wings are battered; their<a name="10872"></a>colour is black, and they have a burnt-up aspect. Gaudy and showy<a name="10873"></a>bees, like gaudy and showy women, are good-for-nothings.<a name="10874"></a><P class="indent">Bees seem to take a pleasure in listening to a rattling noise; and<a name="10875"></a>consequently men say that they can muster them into a hive by rattling<a name="10876"></a>with crockery or stones; it is uncertain, however, whether or no<a name="10877"></a>they can hear the noise at all and also whether their procedure is due<a name="10878"></a>to pleasure or alarm. They expel from the hive all idlers and<a name="10879"></a>unthrifts. As has been said, they differentiate their work; some<a name="10880"></a>make wax, some make honey, some make bee-bread, some shape and mould<a name="10881"></a>combs, some bring water to the cells and mingle it with the honey,<a name="10882"></a>some engage in out-of-door work. At early dawn they make no noise,<a name="10883"></a>until some one particular bee makes a buzzing noise two or three times<a name="10884"></a>and thereby awakes the rest; hereupon they all fly in a body to<a name="10885"></a>work. By and by they return and at first are noisy; then the noise<a name="10886"></a>gradually decreases, until at last some one bee flies round about,<a name="10887"></a>making a buzzing noise, and apparently calling on the others to go<a name="10888"></a>to sleep; then all of a sudden there is a dead silence.<a name="10889"></a><P class="indent">The hive is known to be in good condition if the noise heard<a name="10890"></a>within it is loud, and if the bees make a flutter as they go out and<a name="10891"></a>in; for at this time they are constructing brood-cells. They suffer<a name="10892"></a>most from hunger when they recommence work after winter. They become<a name="10893"></a>somewhat lazy if the bee-keeper, in robbing the hive, leave behind too<a name="10894"></a>much honey; still one should leave cells numerous in proportion to the<a name="10895"></a>population, for the bees work in a spiritless way if too few combs are<a name="10896"></a>left. They become idle also, as being dispirited, if the hive be too<a name="10897"></a>big. A hive yields to the bee-keeper six or nine pints of honey; a<a name="10898"></a>prosperous hive will yield twelve or fifteen pints, exceptionally good<a name="10899"></a>hives eighteen. Sheep and, as has been said, wasps are enemies to<a name="10900"></a>the bees. Bee-keepers entrap the latter, by putting a flat dish on the<a name="10901"></a>ground with pieces of meat on it; when a number of the wasps settle on<a name="10902"></a>it, they cover them with a lid and put the dish and its contents on<a name="10903"></a>the fire. It is a good thing to have a few drones in a hive, as<a name="10904"></a>their presence increases the industry of the workers. Bees can tell<a name="10905"></a>the approach of rough weather or of rain; and the proof is that they<a name="10906"></a>will not fly away, but even while it is as yet fine they go fluttering<a name="10907"></a>about within a restricted space, and the bee-keeper knows from this<a name="10908"></a>that they are expecting bad weather. When the bees inside the hive<a name="10909"></a>hang clustering to one another, it is a sign that the swarm is<a name="10910"></a>intending to quit; consequently, occasion, when a bee-keepers, on<a name="10911"></a>seeing this, besprinkle the hive with sweet wine. It is advisable to<a name="10912"></a>plant about the hives pear-trees, beans, Median-grass, Syrian-grass,<a name="10913"></a>yellow pulse, myrtle, poppies, creeping-thyme, and almond-trees.<a name="10914"></a>Some bee-keepers sprinkle their bees with flour, and can distinguish<a name="10915"></a>them from others when they are at work out of doors. If the spring<a name="10916"></a>be late, or if there be drought or blight, then grubs are all the<a name="10917"></a>fewer in the hives. So much for the habits of bees.</P><a name="10918"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap41">41</a><a name="10919"></a><P class="indent">Of wasps, there are two kinds. Of these kinds one is wild and<a name="10920"></a>scarce, lives on the mountains, engenders grubs not underground but on<a name="10921"></a>oak-trees, is larger, longer, and blacker than the other kind, is<a name="10922"></a>invariably speckled and furnished with a sting, and is remarkably<a name="10923"></a>courageous. The pain from its sting is more severe than that caused by<a name="10924"></a>the others, for the instrument that causes the pain is larger, in<a name="10925"></a>proportion to its own larger size. These wild live over into a<a name="10926"></a>second year, and in winter time, when oaks have been in course of<a name="10927"></a>felling, they may be seen coming out and flying away. They lie<a name="10928"></a>concealed during the winter, and live in the interior of logs of wood.<a name="10929"></a>Some of them are mother-wasps and some are workers, as with the<a name="10930"></a>tamer kind; but it is by observation of the tame wasps that one may<a name="10931"></a>learn the varied characteristics of the mothers and the workers. For<a name="10932"></a>in the case of the tame wasps also there are two kinds; one consists<a name="10933"></a>of leaders, who are called mothers, and the other of workers. The<a name="10934"></a>leaders are far larger and milder-tempered than the others. The<a name="10935"></a>workers do not live over into a second year, but all die when winter<a name="10936"></a>comes on; and this can be proved, for at the commencement of winter<a name="10937"></a>the workers become drowsy, and about the time of the winter solstice<a name="10938"></a>they are never seen at all. The leaders, the so-called mothers, are<a name="10939"></a>seen all through the winter, and live in holes underground; for men<a name="10940"></a>when ploughing or digging in winter have often come upon mother-wasps,<a name="10941"></a>but never upon workers. The mode of reproduction of wasps is as<a name="10942"></a>follows. At the approach of summer, when the leaders have found a<a name="10943"></a>sheltered spot, they take to moulding their combs, and construct the<a name="10944"></a>so-called sphecons,-little nests containing four cells or thereabouts,<a name="10945"></a>and in these are produced working-wasps but not mothers. When these<a name="10946"></a>are grown up, then they construct other larger combs upon the first,<a name="10947"></a>and then again in like manner others; so that by the close of autumn<a name="10948"></a>there are numerous large combs in which the leader, the so-called<a name="10949"></a>mother, engenders no longer working-wasps but mothers. These develop<a name="10950"></a>high up in the nest as large grubs, in cells that occur in groups of<a name="10951"></a>four or rather more, pretty much in the same way as we have seen the<a name="10952"></a>grubs of the king-bees to be produced in their cells. After the<a name="10953"></a>birth of the working-grubs in the cells, the leaders do nothing and<a name="10954"></a>the workers have to supply them with nourishment; and this is inferred<a name="10955"></a>from the fact that the leaders (of the working-wasps) no longer fly<a name="10956"></a>out at this time, but rest quietly indoors. Whether the leaders of<a name="10957"></a>last year after engendering new leaders are killed by the new brood,<a name="10958"></a>and whether this occurs invariably or whether they can live for a<a name="10959"></a>longer time, has not been ascertained by actual observation; neither<a name="10960"></a>can we speak with certainty, as from observation, as to the age<a name="10961"></a>attained by the mother-wasp or by the wild wasps, or as to any other<a name="10962"></a>similar phenomenon. The mother-wasp is broad and heavy, fatter and<a name="10963"></a>larger than the ordinary wasp, and from its weight not very strong<a name="10964"></a>on the wing; these wasps cannot fly far, and for this reason they<a name="10965"></a>always rest inside the nest, building and managing its indoor<a name="10966"></a>arrangements. The so-called mother-wasps are found in most of the<a name="10967"></a>nests; it is a matter of doubt whether or no they are provided with<a name="10968"></a>stings; in all probability, like the king-bees, they have stings,<a name="10969"></a>but never protrude them for offence. Of the ordinary wasps some are<a name="10970"></a>destitute of stings, like the drone-bees, and some are provided with<a name="10971"></a>them. Those unprovided therewith are smaller and less spirited and<a name="10972"></a>never fight, while the others are big and courageous; and these<a name="10973"></a>latter, by some, are called males, and the stingless, females. At<a name="10974"></a>the approach of winter many of the wasps that have stings appear to<a name="10975"></a>lose them; but we have never met an eyewitness of this phenomenon.<a name="10976"></a>Wasps are more abundant in times of drought and in wild localities.<a name="10977"></a>They live underground; their combs they mould out of chips and<a name="10978"></a>earth, each comb from a single origin, like a kind of root. They<a name="10979"></a>feed on certain flowers and fruits, but for the most part on animal<a name="10980"></a>food. Some of the tame wasps have been observed when sexually<a name="10981"></a>united, but it was not determined whether both, or neither, had<a name="10982"></a>stings, or whether one had a sting and the other had not; wild wasps<a name="10983"></a>have been seen under similar circumstances, when one was seen to<a name="10984"></a>have a sting but the case of the other was left undetermined. The<a name="10985"></a>wasp-grub does not appear to come into existence by parturition, for<a name="10986"></a>at the outset the grub is too big to be the offspring of a wasp. If<a name="10987"></a>you take a wasp by the feet and let him buzz with the vibration of his<a name="10988"></a>wings, wasps that have no stings will fly toward it, and wasps that<a name="10989"></a>have stings will not; from which fact it is inferred by some that<a name="10990"></a>one set are males and the other females. In holes in the ground in<a name="10991"></a>winter-time wasps are found, some with stings, and some without.<a name="10992"></a>Some build cells, small and few in number; others build many and large<a name="10993"></a>ones. The so-called mothers are caught at the change of season, mostly<a name="10994"></a>on elm-trees, while gathering a substance sticky and gumlike. A<a name="10995"></a>large number of mother-wasps are found when in the previous year wasps<a name="10996"></a>have been numerous and the weather rainy; they are captured in<a name="10997"></a>precipitous places, or in vertical clefts in the ground, and they<a name="10998"></a>all appear to be furnished with stings.</P><a name="10999"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap42">42</a><a name="11000"></a><P class="indent">So much for the habits of wasps.<a name="11001"></a><P class="indent">Anthrenae do not subsist by culling from flowers as bees do, but<a name="11002"></a>for the most part on animal food: for this reason they hover about<a name="11003"></a>dung; for they chase the large flies, and after catching them lop<a name="11004"></a>off their heads and fly away with the rest of the carcases; they are<a name="11005"></a>furthermore fond of sweet fruits. Such is their food. They have also<a name="11006"></a>kings or leaders like bees and wasps; and their leaders are larger<a name="11007"></a>in proportion to themselves than are wasp-kings to wasps or<a name="11008"></a>bee-kings to bees. The anthrena-king, like the wasp-king, lives<a name="11009"></a>indoors. Anthrenae build their nests underground, scraping out the<a name="11010"></a>soil like ants; for neither anthrenae nor wasps go off in swarms as<a name="11011"></a>bees do, but successive layers of young anthrenae keep to the same<a name="11012"></a>habitat, and go on enlarging their nest by scraping out more and<a name="11013"></a>more of soil. The nest accordingly attains a great size; in fact, from<a name="11014"></a>a particularly prosperous nest have been removed three and even four<a name="11015"></a>baskets full of combs. They do not, like bees, store up food, but pass<a name="11016"></a>the winter in a torpid condition; the greater part of them die in<a name="11017"></a>the winter, but it is uncertain whether that can be said of them<a name="11018"></a>all, In the hives of bees several kings are found and they lead off<a name="11019"></a>detachments in swarms, but in the anthrena's nest only one king is<a name="11020"></a>found. When individual anthrenae have strayed from their nest, they<a name="11021"></a>cluster on a tree and construct combs, as may be often seen<a name="11022"></a>above-ground, and in this nest they produce a king; when the king is<a name="11023"></a>full-grown, he leads them away and settles them along with himself<a name="11024"></a>in a hive or nest. With regard to their sexual unions, and the<a name="11025"></a>method of their reproduction, nothing is known from actual<a name="11026"></a>observation. Among bees both the drones and the kings are stingless,<a name="11027"></a>and so are certain wasps, as has been said; but anthrenae appear to be<a name="11028"></a>all furnished with stings: though, by the way, it would well be<a name="11029"></a>worth while to carry out investigation as to whether the anthrena-king<a name="11030"></a>has a sting or not.</P><a name="11031"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap43">43</a></P><P class="indent">Humble-bees produce their young under a stone, right on the<a name="11032"></a>ground, in a couple of cells or little more; in these cells is found<a name="11033"></a>an attempt at honey, of a poor description. The tenthredon is like the<a name="11034"></a>anthrena, but speckled, and about as broad as a bee.

The lion, while he is eating, is most<a name="11046"></a>ferocious; but when he is not hungry and has had a good meal, he is<a name="11047"></a>quite gentle. He is totally devoid of suspicion or nervous fear, is<a name="11048"></a>fond of romping with animals that have been reared along with him<a name="11049"></a>and to whom he is accustomed, and manifests great affection towards<a name="11050"></a>them. In the chase, as long as he is in view, he makes no attempt to<a name="11051"></a>run and shows no fear, but even if he be compelled by the multitude of<a name="11052"></a>the hunters to retreat, he withdraws deliberately, step by step, every<a name="11053"></a>now and then turning his head to regard his pursuers. If, however,<a name="11054"></a>he reach wooded cover, then he runs at full speed, until he comes to<a name="11055"></a>open ground, when he resumes his leisurely retreat. When, in the open,<a name="11056"></a>he is forced by the number of the hunters to run while in full view,<a name="11057"></a>he does run at the top of his speed, but without leaping and bounding.<a name="11058"></a>This running of his is evenly and continuously kept up like the<a name="11059"></a>running of a dog; but when he is in pursuit of his prey and is close<a name="11060"></a>behind, he makes a sudden pounce upon it. The two statements made<a name="11061"></a>regarding him are quite true; the one that he is especially afraid<a name="11062"></a>of fire, as Homer pictures him in the line-'and glowing torches,<a name="11063"></a>which, though fierce he dreads,'-and the other, that he keeps a steady<a name="11064"></a>eye upon the hunter who hits him, and flings himself upon him. If a<a name="11065"></a>hunter hit him, without hurting him, then if with a bound he gets hold<a name="11066"></a>of him, he will do him no harm, not even with his claws, but after<a name="11067"></a>shaking him and giving him a fright will let him go again. They invade<a name="11068"></a>the cattle-folds and attack human beings when they are grown old and<a name="11069"></a>so by reason of old age and the diseased condition of their teeth<a name="11070"></a>are unable to pursue their wonted prey. They live to a good old age.<a name="11071"></a>The lion who was captured when lame, had a number of his teeth broken;<a name="11072"></a>which fact was regarded by some as a proof of the longevity of<a name="11073"></a>lions, as he could hardly have been reduced to this condition except<a name="11074"></a>at an advanced age. There are two species of lions, the plump,<a name="11075"></a>curly-maned, and the long-bodied, straight maned; the latter kind is<a name="11076"></a>courageous, and the former comparatively timid; sometimes they run<a name="11077"></a>away with their tail between their legs, like a dog. A lion was once<a name="11078"></a>seen to be on the point of attacking a boar, but to run away when<a name="11079"></a>the boar stiffened his bristles in defence. It is susceptible of<a name="11080"></a>hurt from a wound in the flank, but on any other part of its frame<a name="11081"></a>will endure any number of blows, and its head is especially hard.<a name="11082"></a>Whenever it inflicts a wound, either by its teeth or its claws,<a name="11083"></a>there flows from the wounded parts suppurating matter, quite yellow,<a name="11084"></a>and not to be stanched by bandage or sponge; the treatment for such<a name="11085"></a>a wound is the same as that for the bite of a dog.<a name="11086"></a><P class="indent">The thos, or civet, is fond of man's company; it does him no<a name="11087"></a>harm and is not much afraid of him, but it is an enemy to the dog<a name="11088"></a>and the lion, and consequently is not found in the same habitat with<a name="11089"></a>them. The little ones are the best. Some say that there are two<a name="11090"></a>species of the animal, and some say, three; there are probably not<a name="11091"></a>more than three, but, as is the case with certain of the fishes,<a name="11092"></a>birds, and quadrupeds, this animal changes in appearance with the<a name="11093"></a>change of season.

Its horns are crooked, turned inwards towards each other and<a name="11111"></a>useless for purposes of self-defence; they are a span broad, or a<a name="11112"></a>little more, and in volume each horn would hold about three pints of<a name="11113"></a>liquid; the black colour of the horn is beautiful and bright. The tuft<a name="11114"></a>of hair on the forehead reaches down to the eyes, so that the animal<a name="11115"></a>sees objects on either flank better than objects right in front. It<a name="11116"></a>has no upper teeth, as is the case also with kine and all other horned<a name="11117"></a>animals. Its legs are hairy; it is cloven-footed, and the tail,<a name="11118"></a>which resembles that of the ox, seems not big enough for the size of<a name="11119"></a>its body. It tosses up dust and scoops out the ground with its hooves,<a name="11120"></a>like the bull. Its skin is impervious to blows. Owing to the savour of<a name="11121"></a>its flesh it is sought for in the chase. When it is wounded it runs<a name="11122"></a>away, and stops only when thoroughly exhausted. It defends itself<a name="11123"></a>against an assailant by kicking and projecting its excrement to a<a name="11124"></a>distance of eight yards; this device it can easily adopt over and over<a name="11125"></a>again, and the excrement is so pungent that the hair of hunting-dogs<a name="11126"></a>is burnt off by it. It is only when the animal is disturbed or alarmed<a name="11127"></a>that the dung has this property; when the animal is undisturbed it has<a name="11128"></a>no blistering effect. So much for the shape and habits of the<a name="11129"></a>animal. When the season comes for parturition the mothers give birth<a name="11130"></a>to their young in troops upon the mountains. Before dropping their<a name="11131"></a>young they scatter their dung in all directions, making a kind of<a name="11132"></a>circular rampart around them; for the animal has the faculty of<a name="11133"></a>ejecting excrement in most extraordinary quantities.</P><a name="11134"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap46">46</a><a name="11135"></a><P class="indent">Of all wild animals the most easily tamed and the gentlest is<a name="11136"></a>the elephant.

The story goes that, after a dolphin had been caught and<a name="11171"></a>wounded off the coast of Caria, a shoal of dolphins came into the<a name="11172"></a>harbour and stopped there until the fisherman let his captive go free;<a name="11173"></a>whereupon the shoal departed. A shoal of young dolphins is always,<a name="11174"></a>by way of protection, followed by a large one.

It appears to be the fleetest of all animals, marine and<a name="11181"></a>terrestrial, and it can leap over the masts of large vessels. This<a name="11182"></a>speed is chiefly manifested when they are pursuing a fish for food;<a name="11183"></a>then, if the fish endeavours to escape, they pursue him in their<a name="11184"></a>ravenous hunger down to deep waters; but, when the necessary return<a name="11185"></a>swim is getting too long, they hold in their breath, as though<a name="11186"></a>calculating the length of it, and then draw themselves together for an<a name="11187"></a>effort and shoot up like arrows, trying to make the long ascent<a name="11188"></a>rapidly in order to breathe, and in the effort they spring right<a name="11189"></a>over the a ship's masts if a ship be in the vicinity. This same<a name="11190"></a>phenomenon is observed in divers, when they have plunged into deep<a name="11191"></a>water; that is, they pull themselves together and rise with a speed<a name="11192"></a>proportional to their strength.

Birds have their testicles inside, and oviparous<a name="11215"></a>quadrupeds close to the loins; and of viviparous animals that walk<a name="11216"></a>some have them inside, and most have them outside, but all have them<a name="11217"></a>at the lower end of the belly. Birds are castrated at the rump at<a name="11218"></a>the part where the two sexes unite in copulation. If you burn this<a name="11219"></a>twice or thrice with hot irons, then, if the bird be full-grown, his<a name="11220"></a>crest grows sallow, he ceases to crow, and foregoes sexual passion;<a name="11221"></a>but if you cauterize the bird when young, none of these male<a name="11222"></a>attributes propensities will come to him as he grows up. The case is<a name="11223"></a>the same with men: if you mutilate them in boyhood, the<a name="11224"></a>later-growing hair never comes, and the voice never changes but<a name="11225"></a>remains high-pitched; if they be mutilated in early manhood, the<a name="11226"></a>late growths of hair quit them except the growth on the groin, and<a name="11227"></a>that diminishes but does not entirely depart. The congenital growths<a name="11228"></a>of hair never fall out, for a eunuch never grows bald. In the case<a name="11229"></a>of all castrated or mutilated male quadrupeds the voice changes to the<a name="11230"></a>feminine voice. All other quadrupeds when castrated, unless the<a name="11231"></a>operation be performed when they are young, invariably die; but in the<a name="11232"></a>case of boars, and in their case only, the age at which the<a name="11233"></a>operation is performed produces no difference. All animals, if<a name="11234"></a>operated on when they are young, become bigger and better looking than<a name="11235"></a>their unmutilated fellows; if they be mutilated when full-grown,<a name="11236"></a>they do not take on any increase of size. If stags be mutilated, when,<a name="11237"></a>by reason of their age, they have as yet no horns, they never grow<a name="11238"></a>horns at all; if they be mutilated when they have horns, the horns<a name="11239"></a>remain unchanged in size, and the animal does not lose them. Calves<a name="11240"></a>are mutilated when a year old; otherwise, they turn out uglier and<a name="11241"></a>smaller. Steers are mutilated in the following way: they turn the<a name="11242"></a>animal over on its back, cut a little off the scrotum at the lower<a name="11243"></a>end, and squeeze out the testicles, then push back the roots of them<a name="11244"></a>as far as they can, and stop up the incision with hair to give an<a name="11245"></a>outlet to suppurating matter; if inflammation ensues, they cauterize<a name="11246"></a>the scrotum and put on a plaster. If a full-grown bull be mutilated,<a name="11247"></a>he can still to all appearance unite sexually with the cow. The<a name="11248"></a>ovaries of sows are excised with the view of quenching in them<a name="11249"></a>sexual appetites and of stimulating growth in size and fatness. The<a name="11250"></a>sow has first to be kept two days without food, and, after being<a name="11251"></a>hung up by the hind legs, it is operated on; they cut the lower belly,<a name="11252"></a>about the place where the boars have their testicles, for it is<a name="11253"></a>there that the ovary grows, adhering to the two divisions (or horns)<a name="11254"></a>of the womb; they cut off a little piece and stitch up the incision.<a name="11255"></a>Female camels are mutilated when they are wanted for war purposes, and<a name="11256"></a>are mutilated to prevent their being got with young.

Some, also, of the<a name="11272"></a>animals that have teeth in both jaws ruminate; as, for instance, the<a name="11273"></a>Pontic mice, and the fish which from the habit is by some called<a name="11274"></a>'the Ruminant', (as well as other fish).<a name="11275"></a><P class="indent">Long-limbed animals have loose faeces, and broad-chested animals<a name="11276"></a>vomit with comparative facility, and these remarks are, in a general<a name="11277"></a>way, applicable to quadrupeds, birds, and men.</P><a name="11278"></a><p class="chapter"><a name="chap49b">49B</a><a name="11279"></a><P class="indent">A considerable number of birds change according to season the<a name="11280"></a>colour of their plumage and their note; as, for instance, the owsel<a name="11281"></a>becomes yellow instead of black, and its note gets altered, for in<a name="11282"></a>summer it has a musical note and in winter a discordant chatter. The<a name="11283"></a>thrush also changes its colour; about the throat it is marked in<a name="11284"></a>winter with speckles like a starling, in summer distinctly spotted:<a name="11285"></a>however, it never alters its note. The nightingale, when the hills are<a name="11286"></a>taking on verdure, sings continually for fifteen days and fifteen<a name="11287"></a>nights; afterwards it sings, but not continuously. As summer<a name="11288"></a>advances it has a different song, not so varied as before, nor so<a name="11289"></a>deep, nor so intricately modulated, but simple; it also changes its<a name="11290"></a>colour, and in Italy about this season it goes by a different name. It<a name="11291"></a>goes into hiding, and is consequently visible only for a brief period.<a name="11292"></a> The erithacus (or redbreast) and the so-called redstart change into<a name="11293"></a>one another; the former is a winter bird, the latter a summer one, and<a name="11294"></a>the difference between them is practically limited to the coloration<a name="11295"></a>of their plumage. In the same way with the beccafico and the blackcap;<a name="11296"></a>these change into one another. The beccafico appears about autumn, and<a name="11297"></a>the blackcap as soon as autumn has ended. These birds, also, differ<a name="11298"></a>from one another only in colour and note; that these birds, two in<a name="11299"></a>name, are one in reality is proved by the fact that at the period when<a name="11300"></a>the change is in progress each one has been seen with the change as<a name="11301"></a>yet incomplete. It is not so very strange that in these cases there is<a name="11302"></a>a change in note and in plumage, for even the ring-dove ceases to<a name="11303"></a>coo in winter, and recommences cooing when spring comes in; in winter,<a name="11304"></a>however, when fine weather has succeeded to very stormy weather,<a name="11305"></a>this bird has been known to give its cooing note, to the<a name="11306"></a>astonishment of such as were acquainted with its usual winter silence.<a name="11307"></a>As a general rule, birds sing most loudly and most diversely in the<a name="11308"></a>pairing season.

It departs<a name="11310"></a>about the rising of the Dog-star, and it reappears from springtime<a name="11311"></a>to the rising of the Dog-star.
