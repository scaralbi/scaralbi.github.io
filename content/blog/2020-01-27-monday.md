Everyone has a ring  
to bear alone  
A mission to complete  
before it's dawn  
it slowly takes away  
some bits of soul  
But shines the light of life  
to our empty cores.  

To follow this beam  
is the only truth I know  
everything else is illusory  
the common appearances disappear  
all phenomena extinguish  
merging with the void.  
Stepping off the track  
would lead to this vacuum.  

While walking on the path  
Hints will appear  
Suggesting if you are elected  
The light will unites with the space  
becoming one thing, inseparable  
You will feel your mass  
resonating with the space-time,  
the mesh of reality   

Sometimes I wish  
I had someone  
to share this weight  
but suddenly, out of the blue,  
I saw memories and pictures of you    
the adventures shaped me into who I am  
but a ring has just one hole  
this mission has to be completed alone.
