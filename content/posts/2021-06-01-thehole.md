title: A Local Life

---

Within the hole  
We slide, we fall  
The power comes   
From something else  
We need to share our joys  
Our pains with other   
People that we like  
This constant need   
Of social beings is   
What makes us  
enjoy the life  
The thing is that   
The local niche  
Matters way more  
Than memories  
Or things we did   
Back in the the past  
But in the dreams   
Or with some beings  
We are one together   
The same thing   
So we don’t even need  
To send each other   
Lengthy texts   
Too bad we still have got to eat  
And feed the animals in us  
But soon we will connect   
Through dreams   
Or even electrically.  
Such local life   
In global terms   
ultimately   
Is what we do.  
So let’s not waste   
More precious time   
That only ends  
Materially  
I love the mystic   
Painful love   
That resonates  
Within my guts.
