title: The legends of my rivers

---

The Piave was mumbling   
in a calm and peaceful way    
to the soldiers crossing  
on the 24th of May.  
The army was marching   
to reach the frontier  
and make against the enemy  
a barrier.    

The Thames was shimmering  
in a greenish shade of grey  
as three students were enjoying    
London on a sunny day.   
Sparse clusters of people    
cluttering the streets   
were reachable cathedrals    
to the eyes of viral fleets.     

The Po was whispering    
in a state of posh decay  
to some friends reminiscing  
as the virus went away.  
"Leave the world outside unspoiled  
from the influence of the men"  
said the river with sarcasm  
as men polluted it again.  

The Cam was hissing  
gently by the Bridge of Sighs  
as some scholars were discussing   
on the origin of life.   
If there is no shared ancestor  
between a virus and its host,  
who is the alien impostor  
that evolved to gain control ?
