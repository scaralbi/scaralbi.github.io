title: Sonnet to the Simulator

---

There is someone who plays with me    
Perhaps the fate that pulls the strings    
Someone whose aims I cannot see    
Has bound my mind to look for rings    

Although in myths I disbelieve    
My dreams are filled with fairy scenes:    
Some fawns gallop towards the eaves  
of leafy hills with naked teens    

This one who crafts my illusioned self  
instills my ideas with magic sound  
It makes me wish I were an elf  
and dig up diamonds from the ground  

O fiery spirit in my mind  
Your life is just of different kind
