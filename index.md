# Hello visitor ! Welcome to my webpage

This is just my personal space in the web.  
It is essentially an open google drive on the internet.  
I use it to store ideas, stories and literally anything that I consider worth sharing.  

# What can you find here ?
A lot of stuff that might be irrelevant to you.
You can find notes about subjects I have studied (Biotechnology, Biophysics, Synthetic Biology...).  
 - [Notes](./notes/notes.html)   
Sometimes I also write poetries and thoughts in an incoherent way. You can read some of this stuff in my blog.  
 - [Blog](./blog.html)  
 I am also very interested in the field of synthetic biology. If you are interested as well, you can check out the project page.
