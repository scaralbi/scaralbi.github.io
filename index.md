> Homo liber nulla de re minus quam de morte
cogitat; et ejus sapientia non mortis sed vitae
meditatio est.  
(There is nothing over which a free man ponders
less than death; his wisdom is, to meditate not on
death but on life.)  
[SPINOZA'S Ethics, Pt IV, Prop.67]

What is life if not extracting electrons from something and use them to generate an electrochemical potential across a phase that drives us far, far away from equilibrium? Physical separation of protons though membranes allow this. I like to think that Rothkoâ€™s paintings illustrate the electrochemical gradient with different chromatic fields. I see the thick orange lines as the membranes, the top orange field as the cytoplasm and the white space as the lumen full of protons. Illustrated below in the inner membrane with the two separate motors is, of course, the ATP synthase (PDB: 6CP3).
