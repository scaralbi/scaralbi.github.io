## What is this ?
This is just my personal site on the web.
I use it to record thoughts and share information.

> Homo liber nulla de re minus quam de morte
cogitat; et ejus sapientia non mortis sed vitae
meditatio est.  
(There is nothing over which a free man ponders
less than death; his wisdom is, to meditate not on
death but on life.)  
[SPINOZA'S Ethics, Pt IV, Prop.67]

## Bio
I am a 23 years old human being. I am particularly excited about synthetic biology, cyanobacteria, and anything that aims to engineer sustainability in our biosphere.
I completed my BSc in biotechnology from Imperial College London in 2019. There I took part in [iGEM]() and came into contact with synthetic biology. I wrote my final year thesis under the supervision of [Robert Endres](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/r.endres) and became quickly interested in the field of systems biology. For my thesis, I developed a novel biophysical model to simulate spatially heterogeneous microbial communities and clarify the so-called "paradox of the plankton". I am now doing a PhD in Biochemistry  at the University of Cambridge, as part of the [BBSRC-DTP programme](https://bbsrcdtp.lifesci.cam.ac.uk/). Here I evolved a passion for the biophysics of microbial biofilms in the group of [Diana Fusco](https://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-diana-fusco) at the Cavendish Laboratories. For my PhD project, I am trying to understand how and why cyanobacteria can produce electricity in the [Howe](https://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk/howe) Lab at the Department of Biochemistry .
