# Hello and welcome to my webpage

This is just my personal space in the web.
It is essentially an open google drive on the internet
I use it to store ideas, stories, projects etc...

# What can you find here ?
A lot of stuff that might be irrelevant to you.
You can find notes about subjects I have studied (Biotechnology, Biophysics, Synthetic Biology...).
 - [Notes](./notes/notes.html) about the subjects I studied
You can read about projects I have took part in (if you are interested in synthetic biology):
 - [Projects](./projects/projects.html)
I also write a lot about my life in an incoherent way. You can read some of my poetries and thoughs about all sort of stuff.

# The Mission

I am fascinated by the process of photosynthesis, which enables photosynthetic organisms to perform the complex chemistry of transforming solar into chemical energy, in ambient conditions and in a self-repairing way. I believe that unravelling this biochemical process can catalyse the transition towards a greener future, where biomanufacturing of therapeutics, commodity chemicals and biofuels will take place in photosynthetic organelles.

The increased programmability provided by synthetic biology has the potential to pave the way for the industrial adoption of cyanobacteria as microfactories for photobiomanufacturing and bioenergy. This  is an important step for the mission of building a global bioeconomy and improving sustainability in the biosphere.



# About me

I am a 22 years old human being. At the moment I am located in the UK.
I was born in Italy in 1997. I lived in Torino until 2016.
