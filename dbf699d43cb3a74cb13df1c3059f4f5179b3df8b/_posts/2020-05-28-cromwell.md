Farewell, Cromwell Republic

Your walls shielded our lives
during these undergraduate times.
And now the we have to go. 
is sad to empty your rooms.  
Your treasure was a collection. 
of trinkets and traffic signs.  
Your roof was like a gateway.  
for higher states of the mind.
The space that you provided  
was a monastery of free speech.  
You promptly offered us asylum  
when the Kingdom fell into pieces. 

Deeply you will be missed,
liberal Cromwellian home.
Even the endless stairsteps
that led to your third floor.
Also your dirty fridge,
which was a bacterial lab.
Never we will forget 
the bathroom which is a submarine
the nights we slept on the couch,
the  bikinis
