# What is Synthetic Biology ?

Synthetic biology is an emerging field of scientific research.
It is very interdisciplinary:  biochemistry,  biology, physics, computer science, art and design and many more.
The goal is to engineer organisms to perform desired tasks.
This engineering of biology has many important implications.


# iGEM
The international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition is the world’s largest Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build synthetic biological systems and operate them in living cells.
These student teams come from all over the world and spend the six months preceding the competition developing novel technologies in a wide range of areas from healthcare to energy and food. Every year iGEM unites more than 3,000 high school, undergrad, and postgrad students in Boston for a 4-day “jamboree” celebrating their achievements in and enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology.
Imperial iGEM teams have consistently proven themselves on the world stage. Over the past 12 years, the teams have won with 3 Grand Prizes, 10 Gold Medals and 17 other awards.
This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. Most of the students that take part in the competition end up pursuing PhDs in top universities across the world. The Imperial iGEM projects have significantly contributed to published scientific knowledge in the fields of optogenetics, biosensors, biomaterials, synthetic cultures and electrogenetics. In addition, the competition is a great proving ground for startup ideas. iGEM alumni, of which there are 30,000+, include many entrepreneurs running high-growth companies. Notably, the startups Ginkgo Bioworks, CustoMEM, LabGenius, Bolt Threads and many more.

In the summer 2018 I took part in this competition as part of the Imperial College team. It is unbelieveble how much stuff you can do when you are a part of a team of hard-working people that share your same mission.
I was working in the wet lab, where I learned how to design and assemble genetic circuits that can be switched on and off by controlling the oxidation status of redox-mediators using a custom made electrode set-up.
We made the first voltage-inducible genetic constructs (BBa_K2862021), which outputs GFP at oxidizing potentials and is repressed by reducing potentials.
We developed an experimental protocol to optimise the chemical conditions of the system to maximise the biological response of the electrogenetic device without significantly impacting cell viability. This used a plate reader to measure the redox status of the system by following the time course of the absorbance of ferrocyanide and ferricyanide, while concomitantly quantifying GFP fluorescence and cell density.
We then constructed a library of electrogenetic parts for use in future electrogenetic projects.  We assembled the electrogenetic library into 48 different constructs using the next-generation BASIC assembly method. With a plate reader, we then characterised the library to find orthogonality between transcription factors and promoters.
Participating in iGEM gave me the opportunity to experience the life of a researcher, teaching me how to design the right experiments to answer scientific questions, interpret scientific data and exploit failures as inputs for new hypotheses. This fortified my determination to carry on my studies at a doctoral level.


# BIOMOD

BIOMOD is an annual biomolecular design competition for students.
Undergraduate teams compete to build the coolest stuff using the molecules of life. Previous winners have used DNA, RNA, and proteins as building blocks to create autonomous robots, molecular computers, and prototypes for nanoscale therapeutics. Students lead projects each summer and then travel to San Francisco in late October to present their work and win awards.
In the summer 2019 I took part in this competition as part of the Imperial College team.
