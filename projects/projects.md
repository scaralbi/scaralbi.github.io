# iGEM
The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM) is the world’s largest Synthetic Biology competition. Student teams are given a kit of biological parts from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Working at their own schools over the summer, they use these parts and new parts of their own design to build synthetic biological systems and operate them in living cells.
These student teams come from all over the world and spend the six months preceding the competition developing novel technologies in a wide range of areas from healthcare to energy and food. Every year iGEM unites more than 3,000 high school, undergrad, and postgrad students in Boston for a 4-day “jamboree” celebrating their achievements in and enthusiasm for Synthetic Biology.
Imperial iGEM teams have consistently proven themselves on the world stage. Over the past 12 years, the teams have won with 3 Grand Prizes, 10 Gold Medals and 17 other awards.
This project design and competition format is an exceptionally motivating and effective teaching method. Most of the students that take part in the competition end up pursuing PhDs in top universities across the world. The Imperial iGEM projects have significantly contributed to published scientific knowledge in the fields of optogenetics, biosensors, biomaterials, synthetic cultures and electrogenetics. In addition, the competition is a great proving ground for startup ideas. iGEM alumni, of which there are 30,000+, include many entrepreneurs running high-growth companies. Notably, the startups Ginkgo Bioworks, CustoMEM, LabGenius, Bolt Threads and many more.

# BIOMOD

Biomod is an international student competition in biomolecular modeling.

# Synthetic biology of photosynthetic organisms

Synthetic biology is an emerging field of scientific research. It is very interdisciplinary:  biochemistry,  biology, physics, computer science, art and design and many more.
The goal is to engineer organisms to perform desired tasks. This engineering of biology has many important impligations.
Photosynthetic organisms are the basis of life on Earth.
