    <p>A deadly foe of RNA<br>
lingers around the planet Earth<br>
the borders shut, the people fear<br>
the world stops spinning for a while.</p>
<p>Now Cambridge seems a ghostly town<br>
just like the paintings from the plague<br>
The College sends their students home<br>
our home is here, so here we stay.</p>
<p>There is no soul that goes around<br>
the leafy roads that bring to town<br>
We can enjoy the rising spring<br>
as the whole world is in lockdown.</p>
<p>You can not kill what does not live<br>
but then how to ged rid of it?<br>
Somehow some Y-shaped globulin<br>
will find the way to the virion.</p>
<p>The steady-state will be restored<br>
as this is Nature&rsquo;s greedy aim<br>
to overshoot towards the chaos<br>
and find the peace that was once lost.</p>
