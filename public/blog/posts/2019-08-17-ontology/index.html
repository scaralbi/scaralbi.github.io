    <p>Sometime I dream to be able to rationally control  what is and what is not. That is, to hold the keys for ontological decision.
For example, when editing genomes of E. coli by inserting new genetic circuits, I don&rsquo;t think I am actually controlling the essence of E. coli itself. I am just speeding up a reaction.
However, isn&rsquo;t controlling the direction of certain reactions the nature of beings?
I am quite confused about this point.
Are we creating new life, or just accelerating natural evolution ?
The boundary is pretty blurred.</p>
