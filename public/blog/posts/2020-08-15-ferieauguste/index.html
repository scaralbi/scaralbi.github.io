    <p>Amidst the turmoil of the world<br>
while the pandemic spreads around <br>
nationalistic fears arise <br>
and racist wars are gaining ground.</p>
<p>In this unprecedented times<br>
I felt the urge to take a break<br>
So I phoned my friends  <br>
and took a plane<br>
to fly to the Sardinian shores</p>
<p>An airbus full of British lads<br>
brought me safe to the motherland<br>
Then Ale reached me with a car, <br>
we drove to Alghero around midnight.</p>
<p>The town was filled with lively youth<br>
We ate and drank and read a book<br>
and slept outside a police yard.<br>
At dawn we parted for the south,<br>
where we reached the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>From there more friends joined in the trip<br>
we formed a convoy of four cars<br>
and without plans nor reckonings <br>
we toured gaily around the isle.</p>
<p>We did not touch a single bed,<br>
but every night on virgin sands<br>
we wildly camped and felt at home.</p>
<p>I wished I always lived liked this:<br>
with freedom, friends and by the sea.<br>
No thoughts, no news, just harmony<br>
with the surrounding eartlhy peace.</p>
