    <p>There was music in the chapel,<br>
a choir of young and tuneful voices.<br>
They were as sweet as Adam&rsquo;s apple,<br>
they cured the sorrows on our faces.</p>
<p>The organ, playing in concert<br>
with those mellifluous, holy chords,<br>
made my sensations all inert,<br>
and caused my eyes to move upwards.</p>
<p>We then moved to the dining hall<br>
where the feast started with a gong:<br>
some fellows entered from the door,<br>
we sang in phase a latin song.</p>
<p>From there it all blurred out of space;<br>
I felt the spirit of the corpse<br>
while crimson lips were singing Grace.</p>
