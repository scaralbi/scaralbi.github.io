    <p>When I think about the future, a feeling of fear and excitement arises. Yet I always live in the same moment. Life is a process of adding up, looking at the terminal values of a function and calculating the average. It is just an autopoietic network. We feel alive because of the properties emerging from the millions of reactions happening in every cell. However I still hope to escape the cold determinism that is dictated by this point of view. By thinking and connecting all the thought into a theory, by formalising the actions and bureaucratising the ways of thinkin, humansÂ rationalised the world. We imposed to the world a new change, as did several forms of life before us. For example, cyanobacteria literally oxygenated the world. Before them, Earth had no oxygen. Through the new evolutionary tool of photosynthesis, they converted carbon dioxide and water into oxygen. Earth was soon surrounded by our favourite bimolecular drug.
Today there are rightful concerns that we are &ldquo;modifying&rdquo; our planet.
We need to respect and preserve our Planet, as a gift for our grandchildren. However our grandparents left us with the most changed planet in the galaxy. What an example. Cyanobacteria had no idea that they were changing the atmospheric concentration of oxygen. This change was so irreversible and drastic, that as a result humans evolved. Now this cycle is inverted, with us pumping carbon dioxide in the environment. Maybe we are even fertilising cyanobacteria with this extra carbon dioxide (apart the rise in temperature that denatures Rubisco).
Every form of life leaves a mark in the ecological landscale. Everyone wants a new colony here to put a flag on.
what is sure is that we are leaving to our descendants a hotter place. They sure will have to face new challenges, a new science will counsel the industries that will change again the new world. Yet it seems impossible to be changing the world. Our ideas are leading to this. Our rationality is the actor behind all of this theatre. It is beautiful how we are just a tiny gear, which rotates the bigger gear upon us. Perhaps there is something above or perhaps we, as a whole, are above.</p>
