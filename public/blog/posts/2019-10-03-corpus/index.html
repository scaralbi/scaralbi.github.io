    <p>A territory flat and wet <br>
swiftly appeared into my sight <br>
whilst I was flying like a jet<br>
on the black saddle of my bike.</p>
<p>The twigs formed branches from the trees,<br>
I thought about the chloroplast, <br>
the forestry was full of bees:<br>
a living temple from the past.</p>
<p>On Saturday: a feast in hall,<br>
which fed both gut and mainly soul.<br>
The leaves were red: in fact it&rsquo;s fall!<br>
I feel as fresh as a tadpole.</p>
<p>Then Sunday came, with overhangs&hellip;<br>
I went to town, dressed up, and heard<br>
seraphic tunes in holy songs,<br>
which made me feel high as a bird.</p>
