    <p>A cannon under Newnham bridge<br>
marks the beginning of the race.<br>
The river shakes, the boats set pace,<br>
to row the fastest to Cambridge</p>
<p>The swans fly off scared and confused<br>
We slide three quarters, half and half <br>
We fly like eagles with Gandalf<br>
It&rsquo;s time to show how much we cruised.</p>
<p>Around you: bikes, whistles and screams<br>
Inside you: grit, balance and pain   <br>
Don&rsquo;t throw your efforts all in vain <br>
Just row to bump the other teams.</p>
<p>At Ditton&rsquo;s corner strokers push <br>
At Grassy&rsquo;s, bows will make the race <br>
The cox will lead the deadly chase<br>
by now the pain&rsquo;s around your tush</p>
<p>If valiantly your crew fights off<br>
a constant whistle will be heard<br>
a final push, be not aferd<br>
and then the bump: spatapapoff.</p>
<p>And when the boat club dinner starts<br>
all sacrifices will be worth<br>
the feast will signal a rebirth<br>
and may the spirits warm our hearts.</p>
