    <p>Inside a transatlantic plane,<br>
flying towards the western lands<br>
some thoughts arose with in my brain<br>
of human quests and hidden hands.</p>
<p>The humankind has civilised<br>
all earthly corners with his mind.<br>
The air I breathe is pressurised,<br>
the path I chase was predesigned.</p>
<p>Walking in town along the streets,<br>
which crooked climb towards the hills,<br>
I wished my feet were naval fleets<br>
with sails as soft as daffodils.</p>
<p>But dreams must be more cum ber some:<br>
To win the race against microbes,<br>
save pangean loops that will succumb<br>
with fuels to fuel new redox globes.</p>
<p>Glory be to God, the pioneers, <br>
and all the genetic engineers.</p>
