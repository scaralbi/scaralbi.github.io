    <p>It started Friday at 5 pm<br>
a night with mates of biochem.<br>
Soon is September, summer ends:<br>
let&rsquo;s go to Holborn with some friends.</p>
<p>We saw the office where James works,<br>
the wines that stain the bottle corks<br>
The games of beer pong after pool<br>
recall the youthful years of school</p>
<p>O night you blur the fine divide<br>
between my soul and what&rsquo;s outside</p>
<p>The path then led to China Town,<br>
we ordered food and settled down.<br>
It smelled of dumplings and sake.<br>
At 4 am we&rsquo;re still awake.</p>
<p>On Saturday the sky now pales,<br>
along the pentatonic scales<br>
vibrate the guitars in accord<br>
to praise the arrival of the Lord</p>
<p>I love these nights, this life, my friends<br>
when you believe, it never ends.</p>
