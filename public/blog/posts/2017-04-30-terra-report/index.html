    <p>I have just finished watching the documentary &ldquo;Terra&rdquo;, narrated by the great Sir David Attenborough. Below is just what I think.
Man was aware of the existence of other human beings and started painting them. “That consciousness is what changed everything”, this is the message that Terra tries to convey. The main focus is on the development of the artistic and then intellectual faculty in order to be always ahead of nature. Hunting became an exchange, life was in everything, it was possible to it and soon religion appeared. Is a review of the tools human used to dominate planet Earth and an invite to reconnect with out mother. It offers a sad yet positive perspective about our future and the future of our descendandts. Despite the exaggerated apocalyptic vision about chemicals, meat and GMOs industry, the overall message is explicated through scientific and technical visual effects, a fascinating evolutionary perspective of human culture and an intriguing naturalistic approach. The final invite to reconcile with the planet in order to discover the nature of our humanity personally gave me the hope for a better humanitarian technocracy in our near future. The highly branched network between industry, finance, science and governmental institution will be able to direct and orient our rich resources towards the tackling of the problems of the world. Which is what is increasingly happening at the time I am writing.
The awareness of an issue and the willingness to address it is the starting point of saving our Terra.</p>
