<p>Michael Praetorius (1571-1621) was a German composer, organist, and music theorist, known for his versatility and significant contributions to the development of musical forms based on Protestant hymns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>â€œBransle de Villages&quot; is a dance piece from Praetorius&rsquo; collection &ldquo;Terpsichore,&rdquo; one of the largest unified collection of instrumental music from early 17^th Germany. The term &ldquo;bransle&rdquo; began to refer to a dance of apparently rustic origin in France around 1500, meaning &ldquo;to sway, wobble,&rdquo; and referring to the side-to-side movement of the dance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The piece is part of a collection that Praetorius assembled and arranged, but it&rsquo;s unknown how many, or if any, of the works in the collection were actually composed by Praetorius as opposed to being popular dance tunes arranged by him.</p>
