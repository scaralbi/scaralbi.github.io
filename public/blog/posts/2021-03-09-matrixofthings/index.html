    <p>This is the new beginning<br>
Where there is no end<br>
The key is registering entities<br>
In the matrix of living things<br>
I can remember writing<br>
Sentences full of meanings<br>
But now only some snippets<br>
Can be captured at a given time<br>
In these times of connectivity<br>
across space and even time<br>
It is often easier to read<br>
Than to write or find a rhyme<br>
A telemediatic tempest<br>
Is raging across our brains<br>
But I am still just a human<br>
Adapting to my local life</p>
