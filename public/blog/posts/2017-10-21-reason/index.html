    <p>Putting reason into work is like putting a general currency across different countries. It is the general ratio that lies behind the phenomena of the absolute world. A paper that is written logically is more deeply intertwined, therefore it has more perspectives to explicate. A deeper meaning. A comprehensive solving ability, needed to explain the world. This is why I invest in reason: to obtain knowledge, which translates into factual power.</p>
