    <p>A grassy footpath leads you where<br>
the river slides beneath the trees<br>
towards the town of Grantchester,<br>
along the meadows and the bees.</p>
<p>There are some cows that eat the greens<br>
and fishers splashing in the ponds<br>
while students punt along the streams<br>
The sun sets orange far beyond.</p>
<p>There is a peace this place conveys<br>
That many tried to put in rhymes<br>
Like Rupert Brooke and the Pink Floyds<br>
And even the young Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Here is as if Classics never died<br>
It&rsquo;s like Arcadia in the UK<br>
The youth enjoys the riverside<br>
While birds are singing with the bay.</p>
<p>Some people swim along the Cam<br>
Others indulge in drinking beer<br>
Beneath a tree around Newnham<br>
A rope swings from a willow tree.</p>
<p>The green that melts along the blue<br>
Bridges the water with the land,<br>
where friends on blankets eat and drink<br>
Some deshelled nuts and ice cold pimms</p>
<p>This place is where a go for runs<br>
Or swimming sessions when it&rsquo;s warm<br>
It makes me feel part of a whole,<br>
as in symbiosis with the world.</p>
