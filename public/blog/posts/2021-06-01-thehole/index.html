    <p>Within the hole<br>
We slide, we fall<br>
The power comes<br>
From something else<br>
We need to share our joys<br>
Our pains with other<br>
People that we like<br>
This constant need<br>
Of social beings is<br>
What makes us<br>
enjoy the life<br>
The thing is that<br>
The local niche<br>
Matters way more<br>
Than memories<br>
Or things we did<br>
Back in the the past<br>
But in the dreams<br>
Or with some beings<br>
We are one together<br>
The same thing<br>
So we don’t even need<br>
To send each other<br>
Lengthy texts<br>
Too bad we still have got to eat<br>
And feed the animals in us<br>
But soon we will connect<br>
Through dreams<br>
Or even electrically.<br>
Such local life<br>
In global terms<br>
ultimately<br>
Is what we do.<br>
So let’s not waste<br>
More precious time<br>
That only ends<br>
Materially<br>
I love the mystic<br>
Painful love<br>
That resonates<br>
Within my guts.</p>
