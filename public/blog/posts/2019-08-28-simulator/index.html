    <p>There is someone who plays with me <br>
Perhaps the fate that pulls the strings <br>
Someone whose aims I cannot see <br>
Has bound my mind to look for rings</p>
<p>Although in myths I disbelieve <br>
My dreams are filled with fairy scenes: <br>
Some fawns gallop towards the eaves<br>
of leafy hills with naked teens</p>
<p>This one who crafts my illusioned self<br>
instills my ideas with magic sound<br>
It makes me wish I were an elf<br>
and dig up diamonds from the ground</p>
<p>O fiery spirit in my mind<br>
Your life is just of different kind</p>
