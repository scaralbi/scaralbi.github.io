<p>Everyone has a ring<br>
to bear alone<br>
A mission to complete<br>
before it&rsquo;s dawn<br>
it slowly takes away<br>
some bits of soul<br>
But shines the light of life<br>
to our empty cores.</p>
<p>To follow this beam<br>
is the only truth I know<br>
everything else is illusory<br>
the common appearances disappear<br>
all phenomena extinguish<br>
merging with the void.<br>
Stepping off the track<br>
would lead to this vacuum.</p>
<p>While walking on the path<br>
Hints will appear<br>
Suggesting if you are elected<br>
The light will unites with the space<br>
becoming one thing, inseparable<br>
You will feel your mass<br>
resonating with the space-time,<br>
the mesh of reality</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish<br>
I had someone<br>
to share this weight<br>
but suddenly, out of the blue,<br>
I saw memories and pictures of you <br>
the adventures shaped me into who I am<br>
but a ring has just one hole<br>
this mission has to be completed alone.</p>
