    <p>We could sense life<br>
through the meshwork of space<br>
by associative thinking.<br>
Everything was one<br>
when unfiltered by the self,<br>
like a string<br>
resonating with itself.<br>
There is evil in suffering.<br>
There is holism in ecology.<br>
Can you feel it?<br>
Are you excruciated?<br>
In everything we do<br>
we should abdicate the self<br>
towards the greater good.<br>
But what is greater?<br>
Call it God,<br>
Field<br>
Nature<br>
Void<br>
It is the stuff that permeates everything.<br>
If we cannot understand<br>
the meaning of it all,<br>
then we must create it.<br>
To live is to assign meaning.<br>
There is plenty of time<br>
to live floating<br>
in endless water,<br>
once we are dead.<br>
As long as we are alive,<br>
we strive to disobey<br>
the second law.</p>
