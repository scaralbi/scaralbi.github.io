  <meta name="description" content="Peptide-Oligonucleotide Conjugates (POCs) are nanoscale molecules composed of a nucleic acid moiety covalently attached to a polypeptide moiety (Williams and Chaput, 2010).
How to make NanoPOCs:
Apparently linking DNA and peptides molecules together with covalent bonds is quite easy.
What you need to do is just order DNA molecules that have ends like lego bricks and binds to complementary legos on peptide molecules.
How can you have DNA and peptide molecules ?
Order them from  gene/peptide synthesis companies. We order from IDT which is like the Apple of gene synthesis.
The peptides can be ordered from Sigma Aldrich (now Merck). These are giant corporations that have the monopoly on literally every chemical you need in the lab to perform experiments.">

<h2 id="how-to-make-nanopocs"><em>How to make NanoPOCs:</em></h2>
<p>Apparently linking DNA and peptides molecules together with covalent bonds is quite easy.
What you need to do is just order DNA molecules that have ends like lego bricks and binds to complementary legos on peptide molecules.<br>
<em>How can you have DNA and peptide molecules ?</em><br>
Order them from  gene/peptide synthesis companies. We order from <a href="https://eu.idtdna.com/pages">IDT</a> which is like the Apple of gene synthesis.
The peptides can be ordered from <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/united-kingdom.html">Sigma Aldrich</a> (now <a href="https://www.merck.com/index.html">Merck</a>). These are giant corporations that have the monopoly on literally every chemical you need in the lab to perform experiments.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-does-a-genepeptide-cost"><em>How much does a gene/peptide cost?</em></h2>
<p>Short genes (oligos) are very cheap. A 10-mer costs less than £4.
Peptides have similar prices.This of course only includes molecules without any modification. Modifications include attaching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorophore">fluorophores</a> (molecules that emit EM radiations visible with suitable filters), linkers, lipid molecules (e.g. cholesterol). Any chemical modification is similar to an optional feature of a car.</p>
<h2 id="why-would-you-want-nanopocs"><em>Why would you want NanoPOCs?</em></h2>
<p>For the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular biology</a>, DNA makes RNA, which makes proteins. Essentially, DNA is the software of living things.
Proteins compose the hardware. If you link the two molecules together you have a chimeric molecule that has both faces of the coin.
We (BIOMOD team) want to use them for nanotechnological purposes. The peptide moiety is recognises by a protein. The DNA moiety relays the signal to another DNA molecule (a DNA nanopore). In this way NanoPOCs are units that can exchange protein input into DNA language (and vice-versa).
This compiling function is obvious in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosome">ribosome</a>: the molecule that translates RNA into polymers of amino acids (peptides). In fact the ribosome is composed both of proteins and nucleic acids (rRNAs).</p>
