          <p>We dart on horses with two wheels <br>
Supplanting beings with cold steel <br>
We chase a dragon underground:   <br>
The son of fellows with black gowns</p>
<p>We solve the riddles that he asks <br>
Or else he turns us back to ash <br>
He hunts no gold and seeks no crown<br>
He tracks the patterns like a hound</p>
<p>And when the crested letter comes<br>
the crown will guide us to the throne<br>
If you can read the elvish runes<br>
Your ears shall hear the Imperial tunes:</p>

          <p>I have so many big and existential questions in my head, that fill my thoughts with imaginative joy and curiosity. What are the molecular mechanisms that allow cyanobacteria to release electrons? What is the nature of these electrons&hellip;are they like waves emitted by the cells or perhaps they are trapped in reduced compounds and then further oxidised at an electrode?
Why did bacteria evolve the ability of producing electricity in the first place? What is the advantage? Cam bacteria talk to each other via electrical signals, like our electronics devices?
However, these questions are difficult to answer. They are untestable. How can I test the finality of an adaptive mechanism evolved after years of random natural selection? How can I see if an electron is a wave or a particle if the moment I look at it I change its essence?
This is perhaps what I find the challenge about scientific research: translating untestable fundamental questions into falsifiable statements that I can prove or disprove with experiments in the lab. I think that my mind is very good at generating ideas, finding possible solutions and speculating hypothesis, however it less prone to then compute the detailed constrains and dive into the nitty gritty. Only after periods of very specific study and having considered the most technical factors, I can then think practically and -at least attempt to- formulate testable answers. It is a very alienating process, as it forces the brain to think less like a human and more like a computer. Nonetheless this does not take away the creative/metaphysical inclination of the brain and of human nature. In fact, by defining the epistemological borders, the scientific way nourishes new thoughts and metaphysical ways to overcome those limits. And the formalisation of those ideas and falsifiability test  has to be completed again. A new cycle begins. And this is the beauty of this process. A continuous enrichment of the brain, and -entangled with it- the soul.</p>

          <p>This is the new beginning<br>
Where there is no end<br>
The key is registering entities<br>
In the matrix of living things<br>
I can remember writing<br>
Sentences full of meanings<br>
But now only some snippets<br>
Can be captured at a given time<br>
In these times of connectivity<br>
across space and even time<br>
It is often easier to read<br>
Than to write or find a rhyme<br>
A telemediatic tempest<br>
Is raging across our brains<br>
But I am still just a human<br>
Adapting to my local life</p>

          <p>I have just finished watching the documentary &ldquo;Terra&rdquo;, narrated by the great Sir David Attenborough. Below is just what I think.
Man was aware of the existence of other human beings and started painting them. “That consciousness is what changed everything”, this is the message that Terra tries to convey. The main focus is on the development of the artistic and then intellectual faculty in order to be always ahead of nature. Hunting became an exchange, life was in everything, it was possible to it and soon religion appeared. Is a review of the tools human used to dominate planet Earth and an invite to reconnect with out mother. It offers a sad yet positive perspective about our future and the future of our descendandts. Despite the exaggerated apocalyptic vision about chemicals, meat and GMOs industry, the overall message is explicated through scientific and technical visual effects, a fascinating evolutionary perspective of human culture and an intriguing naturalistic approach. The final invite to reconcile with the planet in order to discover the nature of our humanity personally gave me the hope for a better humanitarian technocracy in our near future. The highly branched network between industry, finance, science and governmental institution will be able to direct and orient our rich resources towards the tackling of the problems of the world. Which is what is increasingly happening at the time I am writing.
The awareness of an issue and the willingness to address it is the starting point of saving our Terra.</p>

          <p>Many species are able to live together with other organisms. They coexist happily and join forces against external threats. Such social lifestyle is found everywhere in nature. Yet we are still not able to design intercellular interactions. If only we could use cells as lego bricks, assemble them together in a medium that allows everyone to grow. In a state where every individual contributes to the community, where there is no competition for limited resources, where there is a highly specialised subdivision of metabolic labour. What would such a community be?<br>
We need first to understand how individual interact with each others…. What is the minimal number of members to join a social contract??<br>
The idea is that where there is a niche, there is a will. There is an opportunity to grasp. The species to first grasp this opportunity will then have a competitive advantage.<br>
We have so much knowledge about axenic cultures in the lab. However, when we try to mix things up than all the castles fall apart.<br>
We need to develop a holistic view of an ecosystem. A view that allows us to  modularise all the process that happen in the ecosystem. A cell or an ecosystem at the end is an electron flow system. A box that strives to maintain the flux between electron donors and sinks. This continous flow of electron drives the electrochemical gradient that fuels life. Like the flow of electrons in human-made circuits fuel our electrical devices.  I suspect that electrogenesis plays a role in the signal transduction of multicellular aggregates of cells. It must be. Electrical stimuli are what allowed our unicellular ancestor to enjoy the multicellular lifestyle. Linking things up with electrons wired our ancestors together. We are now wired by electric fields as well. Electrons evolve societies. In our efforts of directing the evolution of synthetic photosynthetic consortia, electrons can be very useful to achieve exquisite control of cellular functions.  But how to control them ? How to study their fluxes?</p>
