  <meta name="description" content="Research Interest
During my undergraduate degree I developed a passion for synthetic and systems biology: two fields of research that aim to engineer and deconstruct living systems in order to understand their assembly logic.
I am now trying to apply those principles to study how and why certain bacteria are able to sense and generate electrical signals when living in biofilms.
In particular, I am curious about the molecular mechanisms and genetic components that allow cyanobacteria to produce electricity from sunlight, air and water (in so-called biophotovoltaic devices).
I am also keen about developing biophysical techniques to investigate how the evolution of electrical signalling in structured communities of exoelectrogenic photosynthetic bacteria contributes to the emergence of collective properties.">
