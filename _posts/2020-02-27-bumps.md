title: Carnage on the Cam
---


A cannon under Newnham bridge  
marks the beginning of the race.  
The river shakes, the boats set pace,  
to row the fastest to Cambridge  

The swans fly off scared and confused  
We slide three quarters, half and half    
We fly like eagles with Gandalf  
It's time to show how much we cruised.  

Around you: bikes, whistles and screams   
Inside you: grit, balance and pain      
Don't throw your efforts all in vain    
Just row to bump the other teams.   

At Ditton's corner strokers push    
At Grassy's, bows will make the race    
The cox will lead the deadly chase  
by now the pain's around your tush  

If valiantly your crew fights off  
a constant whistle will be heard  
a final push, be not aferd  
and then the bump: spatapoff.  

And when the boat club dinner starts  
all sacrifices will be worth  
the feast will signal a rebirth  
and may the spirits warm our hearts.
