We could sense life   
through the meshwork of space  
by associative thinking.  
Everything was one  
when unfiltered by the self,  
like a string  
resonating with itself.  
There is evil in suffering.  
There is holism in ecology.  
Can you feel it?  
Are you excruciated?  
In everything we do  
we should abdicate the self  
towards the greater good.  
But what is greater?  
Call it God,  
Field  
Nature  
Void  
It is the stuff that permeates everything.  
If we cannot understand  
the meaning of it all,  
then we must create it.  
To live is to assign meaning.  
There is plenty of time  
to live floating  
in endless water,  
once we are dead.   
As long as we are alive,  
we strive to disobey  
the second law.
