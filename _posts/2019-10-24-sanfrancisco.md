In side a tran sa tlan tic plane,
fly ing to wards the wes tern lands
some thoughts a rise with in my brain
of hu man quests and hid den hands.  

The hu man kind has ci vi lised
all earth ly cor ners with his mind.
The air I breathe is pres su rised,
the path I chase was pre de signed.

Wal king in town a long the streets,
which croo ked climb to wards the hills,
