title: Arrival in Cambridge

---

Today starts a new chapter in my life.
In fact, I am now writing from my new room, which is going to me my home for the next 4 years.I arrived in Cambridge on Friday (now is Sunday). I came here by car from Turin with my parents. It took us 3 days, as we stopped in the France to visit the Champagne and Dunkirk.
My room is located in [Leckhampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leckhampton,_Corpus_Christi_College,_Cambridge), the postgraduate site of [Corpus Christi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_College,_Cambridge) College.
The site is just a 10 minute walk from the old building in the centre of town.
It is like a village in the woods.
