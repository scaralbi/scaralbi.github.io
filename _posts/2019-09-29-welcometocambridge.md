title: Arrival in Cambridge

---

Today starts a new chapter in my life.
In fact, I am now writing from my new room, which is going to be my home for the next 4 years.I arrived in Cambridge on Friday (now is Sunday). I came here by car from Turin with my parents. It took us 3 days, as we stopped in the France to visit the Champagne and Dunkirk.
My room is located in [Leckhampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leckhampton,_Corpus_Christi_College,_Cambridge), the postgraduate site of [Corpus Christi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_Christi_College,_Cambridge) College.
The site is just a 10 minute walk from the old building in the centre of town. There is a long driveway with secular trees that guide you towards the entrance of the campus. The place looks like a country house of some british aristocrat. It consists of a large area of land covered in very curated grass, willow and other trees typical of a mixed deciduous woodland. Scattered across the hectars of this forestry there are Victorian buildings, in which there are ca. 6 rooms where students live. At the end of the driveway, almost in the middle of the grove, there is Leckhapton House (picture below).
