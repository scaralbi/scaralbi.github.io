title: Arrival in Cambridge

---

Today starts a new chapter in my life.
In fact, I am now writing from my new room, which is going to me my home for the next 4 years.
I arrived in Cambridge on Friday (now is Sunday). I came here by car from Turin with my parents. It took us 3 days, as we stopped in the France to visit the Champagne and Dunkirk.
