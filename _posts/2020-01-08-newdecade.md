The pleasant start of a new mission.  
The thrilling excitement for earthly pleasures.  
New year is an arbitrary date.  
There is no objective time.  
Then what are these yearly patterns of time that I feel ?  

Today is the present I live,  
in relation to my space-time.  
Let's go back to that past,  
but it's gone...   
Is it not ?  

The past comes back  
we can notice its signs.  
Workers strike while  
some nations collide.  
Why can we not change the future?
