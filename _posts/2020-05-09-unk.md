**Context alert: I have just read the Dune trilogy by Frank Herbert**

I used to hope  
to be some sort  
of Kwisatz Aderach.  
But now I am glad  
That I am not.  
I can enjoy  
the blurry visions,  
the thrilling future,  
the unexpected  
hidden love  
I did not know.  
Whereas Muad'Dib    
is caged within  
his prescient mind  
I can unbiasedly decide  
Which fruits I want  
to taste tonight.  
I don't long for   
a big empire  
I just dream of  
the pink warm skin,  
of your small chin  
above my chest.  
I would not treat you  
as Irulan  
I would entrust you  
my fleshy soul.  
An ornithopter
I would enjoy  
to find refuge  
within your skyes.
