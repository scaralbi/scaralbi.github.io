# Future Work

Hey, did you know we've just started something really neat? We've been playing around with something called Level T plasmids, and we've put them into *Synechocystis sp.* PCC 6803 (that's a kind of cyanobacterium!). Here's something cool: it doesn't have any NOX gene on its own. We've got different plasmids, including one with NOX and one with NOX and SOD from *C. thermalis*. It's like building with science Lego bricks!

But here's the thing, we've got so many questions left, and that's what makes science so thrilling! What if we look into these puzzles?

- **The Color Mystery:** So, we noticed something turning pale in some of the strains. What if we put SOD with NOX? Will the color come back? It's like a science detective story waiting to unfold!
    
- **Electric Cyanobacteria:** Imagine if we could understand how NOX changes the electric activity of the cyanobacteria. It's like tuning a radio but with tiny organisms. We might use something called chronoamperometry experiments for this. It sounds serious, but we'll take it one step at a time.
    
- **More About Those Plasmids:** We've got these plasmids with NOX and SOD. How do they work together? What do they do to the cell? We're on the brink of discovery, but we need to tread carefully and learn more about them.
    
- **A Flashlight on ROS:** NOX might be involved in something called ROS. What if there's a hidden signaling pathway waiting to be found? It's like following a trail in the woods, looking for clues and signs.

You know, these questions aren't easy, and we might not find all the answers. But isn't that what makes this so exciting? We'll put on our thinking caps, pull out our microscopes and lab coats, and see where this adventure takes us. With patience, care, and a sprinkle of curiosity, we might just stumble upon something incredible! Or at least learn a whole lot along the way. Isn't science amazing?
