We dart on horses with two wheels    
Supplanting beings with cold steel    
We chase a dragon underground:      
The son of fellows with black gowns  

We solve the riddles that he asks    
Or else he turns us back to ash    
He hunts no gold and seeks no crown  
He tracks the patterns like a hound  

And when the crested letter comes  
the crown will guide us to the throne  
If you can read the elvish runes  
Your ears shall hear the Imperial tunes:  

"O knighted scientists of the queen  
Go out and build the next machine"
