A normal Friday at 5 pm
the sun is shining like a fern
let's go to Holborn with some friends
it's almost September and summer ends

We go to to We Work
drank free pints
play beer pong
endless pints

The night is brighter with your friends
we heed together the weekend

Familiar faces in China Town
The tube, the alien underground
The smell of dumplings and sake
It's 4 we are still awake

Now it's Saturday and the air is fresh
We play the guitar and make ice cream
We jam with pentatonic scales
