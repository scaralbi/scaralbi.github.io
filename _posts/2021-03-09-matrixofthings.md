title: The New Beginning

---
This is the new beginning  
Where there is no end  
The key is registering entities  
In the matrix of living things  
I can remember writing  
Sentences full of meanings  
But now only some snippets  
Can be captured at a given time  
In these times of connectivity  
across space and even time  
It is often easier to read  
Than to write or find a rhyme  
A telemediatic tempest  
Is raging across our brains  
But I am still just a human  
Adapting to my local life
