A deadly foe of RNA
lingers around the planet Earth
the borders shut, the people fear
the world stops spinning for a while.

Now Cambridge seems a ghostly town
just like the paintings from the plague
The College sends their students home
our home is here, so here we stay.

There is no soul that goes around
the leafy roads that bring to town
We can enjoy the rising spring
as the whole world is in lockdown.

You can not kill what does not live
but then how to ged rid of it?
Somehow some Y-shaped globulin
will find the way to the virion.
