A grassy footpath leads you where  
the river slides beneath the trees  
towards the town of Grantchester,   
along the meadows and the bees.  

There are some cows that eat the greens  
and fishers splashing in the ponds  
while students punt along the streams   
The sun sets orange far beyond.   

There is a peace this place conveys  
That many tried to put in rhymes   
Like Rupert Brooke and the Pink Floyds  
And even the young Wittgenstein.   

Here is as if Classics never died  
It's like Arcadia in the UK  
The youth enjoys the riverside  
While birds are singing with the bay.   

Some people swim along the Cam  
Others indulge in drinking beer  
Beneath a tree around Newnham   
A rope swings from a willow tree.   
 
The green that melts along the blue   
Bridges the water with the land,   
where friends on blankets eat and drink  
Some deshelled nuts and ice cold pimms  

This place is where a go for runs  
Or swimming sessions when it's warm  
It makes me feel part of a whole,   
as in symbiosis with the world.
