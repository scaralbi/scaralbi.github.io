 At first the lipids must be dried  
 just add some nitrogen with pride,    
 a drop of juicy chloroform  
 and then the liposomes will form  

 Turn on the heat at sixty five  
 and shake the vials like a jive.  
 As soon as the oily phase is gone  
 You're done with this and can move on.  

 The liposomes have many spheres  
 You'd like to break them with some spears.  
 As they're too tiny to be aimed,  
 extrude them all, don't be ashamed.  

 To wash away the purple dye  
 Do not forget to purify.
