A territory flat and wet    
swiftly appeared into my sight    
whilst I was flying like a jet  
on the black saddle of my bike.  

The twigs formed branches from the trees,  
I thought about the chloroplast,    
the forestry was full of bees:  
a living temple from the past.    

On Saturday: a feast in hall,  
which fed both gut and mainly soul.  
The leaves were red: in fact it's fall!  
I feel as fresh as a tadpole.   

Then Sunday came, with overhangs...  
I went to town, dressed up, and heard  
seraphic tunes in holy songs,  
which made me feel high as a bird.
