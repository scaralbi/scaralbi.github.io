title: Italian Summer in 2020
---

Amidst the turmoil of the world  
while the pandemic spreads around   
nationalistic fears arise  
and racist wars are gaining ground.
  
In this unprecedented times  
I felt the urge to take a break  
So I phoned my friends  
and took a plane  
to fly to the Sardinian shores  

An airbus not socially distanced  
brought me to Alghero in two hours
where Ale reached me with the car:   
our home for the incoming trip  

The air was warm outside the plane  
the town was colonised by life  
We found Paloma in the place of merchants
