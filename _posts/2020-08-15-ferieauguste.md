Amidst the turmoil of the world   
while the pandemic spreads around    
nationalistic fears arise    
and racist wars are gaining ground.  
  
In this unprecedented times   
I felt the urge to take a break   
So I phoned my friends     
and took a plane   
to fly to the Sardinian shores   

An airbus full of British lads  
brought me safe to the motherland  
Then Ale reached me with a car,    
we drove to Alghero around midnight.  

The town was filled with lively youth   
We ate and drank and read a book  
and slept outside a police yard.  
At dawn we parted for the south,  
where we reached the rest of the crew.  

From there more friends joined in the trip  
we formed a convoy of four cars  
and without plans nor reckonings    
we toured gaily around the isle.    

We did not touch a single bed,   
but every night on virgin sands  
we wildly camped and felt at home.   

I wished I always lived liked this:  
with freedom, friends and by the sea.  
No thoughts, no news, just harmony  
with the surrounding eartlhy peace.
