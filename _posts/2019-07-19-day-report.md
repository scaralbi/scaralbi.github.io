title: Summer 2019 Report

---
I am now in London for the summer. I am living in the Cromwell with Georg and Edward (who is the designer for the team).We are taking part in the BIOMOD competition as part of the Imperial team 2019. Essetially, BIOMOD is to biomolecular modelling as iGEM is to synthetic biology. We are working in the Advanced Hackspace. It feels like being in the Social Netowrk. The environment is very hacky and startuppy. Our project is called "nanodips", for nanoscale DNA Intelligent Pores. We aim to design DNA sequences that fold into hollow barrels and insert into synthetic cells. The application is smart drug delivery.
We are writing the nanodips website from scratch in HTML and CSS.
Making a website is a form of art at the end.
You can create so many different worlds.
We have ordered the DNA to make nanopores and bought pistacchio butter to make gelato.
