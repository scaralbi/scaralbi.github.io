It started Friday at 5 pm
soon is September and summer ends
a night with mates of biochem
let's go to Holborn with some friends

We saw the office where James works
The beer that flows out of the taps
beer pong after pool
Angelic power of the Valar

The night is brighter with your friends
we heed together the weekend

Familiar faces in China Town
The smell of dumplings and sake
It's 4 we are still awake

On Saturday the faces pales
We play the guitar and make ice cream
Along the pentatonic scales
Praise the arrival of the Lord

I love these nights, this life, my friends
when you believe, it never ends
