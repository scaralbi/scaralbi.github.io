It started Friday at 5 pm  
a night with mates of biochem.  
Soon is September, summer ends:  
let's go to Holborn with some friends.  

We saw the office where James works,  
the wines that stain the bottle corks  
The games of beer pong after pool  
recall the youthful years of school  

O night you blur the fine divide  
between my soul and what's outside  

The path then led to China Town,  
we ordered food and settled down.  
It smelled of dumplings and sake.  
At 4 am we're still awake.  

On Saturday the sky now pales,
along the pentatonic scales   
vibrate the guitars in accord  
to praise the arrival of the Lord  

I love these nights, this life, my friends  
when you believe, it never ends.
