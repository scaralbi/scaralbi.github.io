[Intro]  

C#m E D A  
C#m E D A  

[Verse 1]  

N.C.  
You said:  
C#m             E  
      let’s get coffee  
    D              A  
And walk through town  

N.C.  
You said:  
C#m               E  
     Picnic in Grantchester  
D              A  
That would be fine  

N.C.  
You said :  
C#m                   E  
     We should do karaoke  
D               A   
   Or go play hockey  

[Chorus 1]  

C#m                   E  
   You said: so many things  
 D                  A  
   And none of them did happen  
C#m                    E  
   All The things you didn’t do  
 D                     A  
   All the things you didn’t say  

C#m                     E  
   All the things you thought you would do,   
 D         A  
   but you didn’t   
C#m B    E E     
But it’s fine…     
D       N.C.  A  
  You’re so boring   

[Verse 2]  
N.C.  
We said:  
C#m                         E  
    Let’s go play on the street  
D                 A  
    Or make some pasta  
N.C.  
We said:  
C#m                         E  
      Let’s go dive in the Cam  
D                           A  
      Let’s just do it for once  

N.C.   
We said :  
C#m                   E  
   Let’s bike to the sea  
D                  A  
Until we can see Manningtree  

[Chorus 2]:
*4 strums each chord a bit country*

C#m                   E   
    We said so many things  
     D              A  
And all of them did happen  
C#m                       E  
   All The things that we did  
D           A  
   Became reality  
C#m                        E  
    All the things that we actually did do,   
D               A  
They factually happened   
C#m B    E E     
But it’s fine…     
D      N.C.  A  
  We’re not boring   


[Bridge]  

A         D          E E  
Let’s get together soon  
A         D          E E  
Let’s get together soon  
   A          D         E E  
To do all the things to do  
   A          D         E E  


[Chorus 3]  

C#m                  E  
   We said so many things  
    D               A  
And all of them did happen  
C#m                        E  
   All The things that we did  

  D           A  
    Became reality  
C#m                        E  
    All the things that we actually did do,   
D                   A  
    They factually happened   

C#m B    E E     
But it’s fine…     
D      N.C.  A  
  We’re not boring   


[Verse 3]  

N.C.  
They said:  
C#m                 E  
     The sea is too far  
D                     A  
     You’ll never make it  
N.C.  
They said:  
C#m               E  
   The Cam is too cold  
D                   A  
   You’ll just regret it  
N.C.  
They said :  
C#m                    E  
    What are your controls  
 D               A  
    And why Manningtree?  

[Outro]  
C#m                    E  
   They said so many things  
    D                  A  
And none of them will matter   
C#m                           E  
    All The things that we’ll do  
D                   A  
    We’ll see what happens  
C#m                          E  
    All the things that we actually did do,   
 D                  A  
    They factually happened   


C#m   B    E     
We’ll be fine
