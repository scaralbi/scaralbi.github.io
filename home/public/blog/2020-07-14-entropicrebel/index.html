through the meshwork of space
by associative thinking.
Everything was one
when unfiltered by the self,
like a string
resonating with itself.
There is evil in suffering.
There is holism in ecology.
Can you feel it?
Are you excruciated?
In everything we do
we should abdicate the self
towards the greater good.
But what is greater?
Call it God,
Field
Nature

It is the stuff that permeates everything.
If we cannot understand
the meaning of it all,
then we must create it.
To live is to assign meaning.
There is plenty of time
to live floating
in endless water,
once we are dead.
As long as we are alive,
we strive to disobey
the second law.">
