Nothing is at is seems

A mission to complete

it slowly takes away
some bits of soul
But shines the light of life

To follow this beam

everything else is illusory
the common appearances disappear
all phenomena extinguish
merging with the void.
Stepping off the track

<p>Everyone has a ring<br>
to bear alone<br>
A mission to complete<br>
before it&rsquo;s dawn<br>
it slowly takes away<br>
some bits of soul<br>
But shines the light of life<br>
to our empty cores.</p>
<p>To follow this beam<br>
is the only truth I know<br>
everything else is illusory<br>
the common appearances disappear<br>
all phenomena extinguish<br>
merging with the void.<br>
Stepping off the track<br>
would lead to this vacuum.</p>
<p>While walking on the path<br>
Hints will appear<br>
Suggesting if you are elected<br>
The light will unites with the space<br>
becoming one thing, inseparable<br>
You will feel your mass<br>
resonating with the space-time,<br>
the mesh of reality</p>
<p>Sometimes I wish<br>
I had someone<br>
to share this weight<br>
but suddenly, out of the blue,<br>
I saw memories and pictures of you <br>
the adventures shaped me into who I am<br>
but a ring has just one hole<br>
this mission has to be completed alone.</p>
