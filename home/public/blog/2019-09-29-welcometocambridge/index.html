In fact, I am now writing from my new room, which is going to be my home for the next 4 years. I arrived in Cambridge on Friday (now is Sunday). I came here by car from Turin with my parents. It took us 3 days, as we stopped in the France to visit a winery in the Champagne region and the nostalgic shores of Dunkirk.
My room is located in Leckhampton, the postgraduate site of Corpus Christi College.
The site is just a 10 minute walk from the old building in the centre of town. There is a long driveway with secular trees that guide you towards the entrance of the campus. The place looks like a country house of some british aristocrat. It consists of a large area of land covered in very curated grass, willow and other trees typical of a mixed deciduous woodland. Scattered across the hectares of this forestry there are Edwardian buildings, in which there are ca. 6 rooms where students live. At the end of the driveway, almost in the middle of the grove, there is Leckhapton House (picture below).
{:class=&ldquo;img-responsive&rdquo;}
This is the social hub of the campus. Inside there is a living room a dining hall, a bar, a cafeteria and a music room.
My room is in one of the red-bricked buildings that surround Leckhampton. It can be reached from Leckhampton House through a short path covered by chestnut trees. The room is cosy and has everything that I need. Now it gets cold and humid in the night. I hope that when the heaters will be turned on it will get warmer.
Overall I already love the place. For me, that I have always been living in big cities, it feels like being in an elvish woodland realm. There is quite a large population of squirrels here as well. They keep on running around looking for chestnuts on the ground. When a chestnut falls from a tree, several squirrels race towards it. The first to arrive at the precious nut takes it and jumps quickly to his tree. I am trying to become friend with the squirrels by feeding them with pecan nuts. These last two days I went out with shelled pecan nuts around sunset time. They are still afraid of me so they do not take the nuts from my hand but wait until I leave them on the ground. I hope that if I keep on doing this everyday, eventually I will manage to hand them the food.">
