      <p>The Piave was mumbling<br>
in a calm and peaceful way <br>
to the soldiers crossing<br>
on the 24th of May.<br>
The army was marching<br>
to reach the frontier<br>
and make against the enemy<br>
a barrier.</p>
<p>The Thames was shimmering<br>
in a greenish shade of grey<br>
as three students were enjoying <br>
London on a sunny day.<br>
Sparse clusters of people <br>
cluttering the streets<br>
were reachable cathedrals <br>
to the eyes of viral fleets.</p>
<p>The Po was whispering <br>
in a state of posh decay<br>
to some friends reminiscing<br>
as the virus went away.<br>
&ldquo;Leave the world outside unspoiled<br>
from the influence of the men&rdquo;<br>
said the river with sarcasm<br>
as men polluted it again.</p>
<p>The Cam was hissing<br>
gently by the Bridge of Sighs<br>
as some scholars were discussing<br>
on the origin of life.<br>
If there is no shared ancestor<br>
between a virus and its host,<br>
who is the alien impostor<br>
that evolved to gain control ?</p>
