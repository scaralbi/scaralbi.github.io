  <meta name="description" content="To focus on to something scientific is like having a bad habit into which escape. A theory is a conviction that pushes you to look farther. Living is forming habits every day and finding the right balance between sticking to the habits and escape from them to the bad habits we keep as backup. Science is the measure of this balance, the calculation of the effects of a given habit in comparison with its negative counterparts.
That is why no one can program his life beforehand, because the expected values are found in the process; you can have a vague idea of what to become, like deciding to be an organic chemist or a professional basketball player, but the motivation is formed by the progressive habits established during this process called life. If the right amount of energy is devoted to the right amount of activities, if the investments you made turn up to be profitable, then life has succeeded. Otherwise it has succeeded anyway. Because rationality is itself madness, the finalistic calculation of the steps is intrinsically connected with the chaotic transduction of energy. Entropy increases anyway.">

      <p>To focus on to something scientific is like having a bad habit into which escape. A theory is a conviction that pushes you to look farther.
