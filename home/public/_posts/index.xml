      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I am a million of cells&lt;br&gt;&#xA;All dynamic and catalytic&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Why do I&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Remain still&lt;br&gt;&#xA;on this line ?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It is not equilibrium&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Is it a a cellular reality&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or just atomic variety ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I had to follow my own way, I would choose to direct the actions towards a deeper consistency. However, the gap between the integrity of reason and the arbitral factuality of actions is not bridged by a consistent behaviour. The plan is to produce more, where production is intended as the spontaneous manifestation of the information. When the information comes from an alien source it is impossible to produce something but the only outcome is a collage of foreign products. To this point, one can argue that the creative composition of otherâ€™s people actions is per se a product of reason. The key point, however, is that a product has to be filtered by the singular producing reason. If the decoupage is rationally filtered and consistent only within itself, then that can be defined as a genuine product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Brompton road alone&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I found&lt;br&gt;&#xA;That my youth has gone&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I light a cigarette and drink a beer&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But still&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m here&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Striving towards eternity&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Stuck in a bus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Investing in reason</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Putting reason into work is like putting a general currency across different countries. It is the general ratio that lies behind the phenomena of the absolute world. A paper that is written logically is more deeply intertwined, therefore it has more perspectives to explicate. A deeper meaning. A comprehensive solving ability, needed to explain the world. This is why I invest in reason: to obtain knowledge, which translates into factual power.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
