ABSTRACT={The Pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS) has been studied primarily in the context of its role as a quorum-sensing signaling molecule. Recent data suggest, however, that this molecule may also function to mediate iron acquisition, cytotoxicity, outer-membrane vesicle biogenesis, or to exert host immune modulatory activities.}
