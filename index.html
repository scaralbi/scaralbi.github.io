  # Hello visitor ! Welcome to my webpage

  This is just my personal space in the web.
  It is essentially an open google drive on the internet.
  I use it to store ideas, stories and literally anything that I consider worth sharing.

  # What can you find here ?
  A lot of stuff that might be irrelevant to you.
  You can find notes about subjects I have studied (Biotechnology, Biophysics, Synthetic Biology...).
   - [Notes](./notes/notes.html)

  Sometimes I also write poetries and thoughts in an incoherent way. You can read some of this stuff in my blog.
   - [Blog](./blog.html)

  I am also very interested in the field of synthetic biology. If you are interested as well, you can check out the project page, where I try to explain why it is so cool in lay man terms.

  # About me

  I am a 22 years old human being. At the moment I am located in the UK.
  I was born in Italy in 1997. I lived in Torino until 2016.
  I completed my BSc in Biotechnology from Imperial College London in August 2019.
  I am now doing a PhD in synthetic biology at the University of Cambridge.
  See my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/cv.pdf)
